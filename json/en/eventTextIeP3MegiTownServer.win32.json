When I'm done, take\na good look at the \"Soubi\" screen.\n<br>\nYou'll see a new feature called \"My\nCodes\" added. MyCode allows you to\nregister the look of the equipment you\n<br>\nare wearing at the time.  And when you\nselect a registered MyCode, you can\nsee the performance of the equipment\n<br>\nyou are actually equipped with! You\ncan change the look of your equipment\nto that of your registered My Codes\n<br>\nwithout changing the performance of\nthe equipment you are actually\nwearing! If you find a piece of\nequipment you like, register it in My\nCodes.  Then you can keep it as it is.\nThe contents registered in My Codes\nwill not be lost even if you sell the\nequipment. However, if you delete or\nchange it, you will need the equipment\nto register it again, so be careful.\nSo long, my countrymen.<pc>I hope you will enjoy coordinating\nyour outfits to the fullest!
