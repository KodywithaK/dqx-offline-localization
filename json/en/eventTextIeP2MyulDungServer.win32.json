I can't make magic\ntools of any kind. What? You made a\n<br>\nmagic oven that made your cake maker,\nNiblet, a huge success? Hmmm... Yes,\nthat's right. Yes, there may have been\n<br>\nmagic in that oven, but I don't think\nit was the magic.  But I did not\ncreate the magic. Here is a picture of\n<br>\nthe magic oven.  The blacksmith's son\nwill understand when he sees it. Go\nahead, take it.": ""

The magic oven is just a\n<br>\nstory that Niblet told his children in\nthe olden days to amuse them with the\nsecrets of his cake baking.
