I can't say this out loud, but\nthe orphaned daughter of former\n<br>\nEmperor Ja Kuba, Princess Ulta, has a\nbad reputation among the people. The\neccentric princess is a misanthrope.\n<br>\n With the exception of Lord\nGuryanlaksh, she refuses to have\nanything to do with anyone. When she\n<br>\nhas business outside the throne room,\nshe sends her caretaker, the Demon\nGoddess Machine, on an errand. Yes,\n<br>\nthat's right.  If it's Princess Ulta's\ndemonic machine, she might be\nauthorized to issue a permit to enter\n<br>\nthe castle. You can sometimes see that\nDemon Deity's machine in the Imperial\nCity, so you should look for it around\n<br>\nthe plaza. This is about all I can\ntell you.  It was a really good Menko\nbattle.
