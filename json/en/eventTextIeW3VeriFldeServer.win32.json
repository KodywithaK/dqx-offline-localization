A\nbook called \"The Pilgrimage of the Two\nFalls\"?  I remember giving it away to\n<br>\nsomeone to help pay the bills.  You\nwant to hear about it, don't you? It\nwas a guide to the pilgrimage, written\n<br>\nduring the reign of King Laerdice, but\nwhen the queen took over the throne,\nthe contents no longer fit the book. I\n<br>\nbelieve the book you gave me was\nincomplete, but I have read the\ncomplete work.  Let me tell you what I\n<br>\nremember. In that book, there was a\npilgrimage route that took one to the\nKing of the Falls and then to the\n<br>\nQueen of the Falls. The King of the\nFalls is the Great Falls of Innocence.\n I remember that the Queen of the\n<br>\nFalls refers to the waterfalls to the\neast of the Great Forest of Vaas. It\nseems that the purpose of the\n<br>\npilgrimage was to pray to these two\nwaterfalls and obtain the blessings of\nthe God of the Sea. That's all I\n<br>\nremember.
