Some of them may be unique.\nWell, that's a long story, but here's\nthe basic relationship between using\nthe tavern and the Request to Take\nDown Quests. There are also various\nways to register yourself with a\nrequest form if you have it with you\nwhen you \"rooku\" yourself, but you'll\nhave to try them all out.

Once you\nregister, your friends will be\n<br>\nregistered in the bar.  And here's the\nimportant part... Have you ever gotten\na \"Defeat Request\"? This is an item\n<br>\nthat you can sometimes get when you\ndefeat a monster. After registering\nyour friends at the tavern, take the\n<br>\n\"Request for Defeat\" and talk to a\nmember of the Defeat Squad at the\nentrance/exit of the larger towns. He\n<br>\nwill send a friend from the tavern to\nhelp you complete the request. The\nfriend will complete the quest for\nyou! When your friend returns after\ncompleting the quest, you will receive\nthe reward you have earned!  Some of\nthem may be unique. Well, that's a\nlong story, but that's the basics of\nhow to use the tavern and how the\n\"Take Down Requests\" quests work.\nAlso, if you have the requisitions,\nyou can register them together with\nyour own when you \"rooku\" yourself,\nand there are other things you can do.\n It would be nice if we could exchange\ninformation on how to use it\neffectively together with our friends.<endif>": ""

On the other side,\nequip a robe of stars made by a daisy\n<br>\nsmith and a tact of stars made by a\nwoodworker with sincerity +50% by lamp\nsmelting. Finally, the one in the\n<br>\nstarry garb should hold the apology\ndumpling made by the cook, and the\nritual is complete. If there is no\n<br>\nsuitable partner, a single person may\nperform the ritual in two parts, each\nequipped with his or her own costume\n<br>\nand ritual items. Please note that\nwhen the ritual is successfully\ncompleted, the special costume and\nritual items will remain intact, but\nonly the sasa-dango will be presented\nto the heavens as an apology and will\nbe lost.

A Seelenguter is a being\nthat preserves the harmony of the\nworld's power.  The ceremony called\n<br>\n\"Kagome no Ritual\" is performed to\ncreate that harmony. Originally, it\nwas supposed to be performed by us,\n<br>\nthe star beasts, but due to the miasma\nthat was activated during the descent,\nthe 12 star beasts were separated into\n<br>\npieces. The ritual must be performed\non a certain day, at a certain time.\nHowever, the unstable existence of the\n<br>\nnine star beasts has made it difficult\nfor them to join together. Therefore,\nwe decided to ask an Astartian\n<br>\nadventurer to perform the ritual on\nour behalf as part of the Astartian\nRally. When the time comes for the\n<br>\nritual, the nine starbeasts will\nchange locations and reappear in\nAstrutia.  When the time comes, we\n<br>\nwill hold another rally. I hope you\nwill lend me your support again.  I\nlook forward to seeing you at the next\n<br>\nrally.": ""
