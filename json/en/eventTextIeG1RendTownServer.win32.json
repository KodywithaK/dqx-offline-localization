    "<attr><feel_happy_lv1><end_attr>Welcome. I am the Guildmaster of the\nGuild of Toolsmiths, or as I like to\ncall myself, Master Balex. A tool\n<br>\nsmith is one who possesses the\nmiraculous skill to create the tools\nused by the artisans. In other words,\n<br>\na god-like being who reigns over all\ncraftsmen. But you seem to have a\nmysterious blacksmith's table.  Where\n<br>\ndid you get such a valuable item? If\nyou have it, you probably don't need\nthe help of the various craftsmen's\n<br>\nguilds in this world. It's a little\nsad for us, though. If I could give\nyou a little advice, it would be to\n<br>\nlearn the art of blacksmithing. As\nyour blacksmithing level goes up, you\nwill learn various specialties, but I\n<br>\nrecommend that you first increase your\nfirepower and then use a speciality\nthat allows you to hit several squares\n<br>\nat the same time. It depends on the\nshape of the squares. But you need to\nbe careful not to get carried away and\n<br>\noverdo it. Well, as the saying goes,\n\"practice makes perfect.": ""
