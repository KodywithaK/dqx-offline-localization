I'd like to perform\n<br>\nthe ritual quickly, but that's the\nrule. I'll explain. The role of a\nmessenger in the service of the Six\n<br>\nSacred Forces is to elevate a\nreasonably strong adventurer like you\nto a higher level. Come on.<pc>...

Since we\nare underground and close to the river\nof light, we can receive the blessings\n<br>\nof the goddess and perform the\nliberation ritual with ease. Here, let\nme give you this.  This is the\n<br>\nGoddess's violet stone.": ""

It means that the\nritual of the Tribulation is over. Do\n<br>\nyou understand? The last person\nwaiting for you is the Holy Mother of\nWar, one of the Six Saints whom we\n<br>\nHoly Messengers serve. It is rumored\nthat Our Lady of War has appeared in\nthe Badgley Rocks of the Orgreid\n<br>\nContinent. It is said that she now\nresides in a mountain lodge.  You'd\nbetter get your ass in gear.": ""
