After\n<br>\nregistering your friends at the\ntavern, take the \"Request for Defeat\"\nand talk to a member of the Defeat\n<br>\nSquad at the entrance/exit of the\nlarger town.

When your friend\nreturns after completing the quest,\nyou will receive the reward you have\nearned!  Some of them may be unique.\nWell, that's a long story, but here's\nthe basic relationship between using\nthe tavern and the Request to Take\nDown Quests. There are also various\nways to register yourself with a\nrequest form if you have it with you\nwhen you \"rooku\" yourself, but you'll\nhave to try them all out.  It would be\nnice if we could exchange information\non the best ways to use it together\nwith your friends.<else>I'll give you a quick lecture on how\nto use the saloon. First, you need to\n\"self-review\" yourself.  I'll issue a\n<br>\n\"Friendship Testimonial,\" which will\ntell you your approximate current\nstrength. Next, you will give the\n<br>\nSequence to a friend or acquaintance\nwho is adventuring in Astrutia like\nyou. It doesn't have to be someone you\n<br>\nknow in person. All adventurers are\nfriends!  You can tell people all over\nthe place. Then you can exchange\n<br>\nSequences with your friends. Nowadays,\nmany people take pictures of their\nfriends and exchange them. In the old\n<br>\ndays, these sequencils used to be\nhandwritten. If you have a Sequence\nfrom a friend, please come to the\n<br>\nAdventurer's Tavern to register it.\n Any tavern is fine.

After registering\nyour friends at the tavern, take the\n<br>\n\"Request for Defeat\" and talk to a\nmember of the Defeat Squad at the\nentrance/exit of the larger towns.
