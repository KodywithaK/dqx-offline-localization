Greedily seeking victory, the\npaper-menko battlers of the time\nadopted a heavier material that could\n<br>\nwithstand the wind pressure. As a\nresult, only metal noodles survived.\nHowever, metal noodles do not turn\n<br>\nover and are forever outmatched by\nother metal noodles. This obsession\nwith winning put an end to the\n<br>\ntraditional game. Concerned about this\nsituation, the 10th emperor, Dajim\nZida, established a new rule to\n<br>\ndetermine the winner by a three-way\nbet of gold, silver and bronze, and\ntried to keep the Menko culture alive.\n<br>\nThe Menko revolution is later called\n\"Dajim's great wisdom\".
