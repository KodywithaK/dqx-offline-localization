PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_3_1,"This is Gartland Castle Town.\nSurrounded by large rocks,\nIt feels like a town of ogre people."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_4_1,"They don't seem to be able to understand the pros and cons of junk.\nThey're full of brutal people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_5_1,"King Grosner, who rules this town,\nis old, but his subjects trust him\n, and he is someone I respect as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_1_1,"When I come here, I remember when I met {pc} and."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_1,"{pc}, everyone\n, thank you very much."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_2_1,"There are still a lot of guys who look strong.\nI hope to meet them someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_3_1,"Ogres, they're all big after all.\nHehe. But we\nsaved this country!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_4_1,"It's full of\nogres that look as rough as ever!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_5_1,"King Grosner, who rules this town,\nis old, but his subjects trust him\n, and he is someone I respect as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_1,"...Is it okay?\nI left my fiance behind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_2_1,"...There are still a lot of guys who look strong.\nI hope to meet them someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_2,"I think\nwhat I need to do now is help {pc}.\nIt's okay. Arold will understand."

PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_1,"Did you hear the voice too, Maille?\nWhat? What?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_2,"Whatever...\nAs I told Arold earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_3,"I see.\nAs expected,\nyou haven't said anything clearly."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_4_1,"Are you talking about key emblems again? Is this something embarrassing?\nI don't need something like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_1,"Mr. Maille heard that voice, too.\nSo did we."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_2,"I see...\nThank you for your continued support!\nLet's help {pc} together!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_3,"Yes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_2_1,"...Hey, hey {pc}!\nBe careful!\nBut that woman... is no ordinary person."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_3_1,"Ah, that person is also a sage…?\nHe has a different atmosphere than the other sages…"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_4_1,"You must be a big loser\nto have your wallet stolen.\nWell, I looked it over!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_5_1,"Mr. {pc},\nI'm glad you didn't take my money.\nStill, you're an amazing person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_2_1,"...Will the strong people disappear?\nJust because you went on a journey like me doesn't mean\nyou're going to die, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_3_1,"That wise man uses healing techniques?\nDespite appearances, he is a kind person!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_4_1,"These guys can only fight\nJust leave them alone!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_5_1,"Strong people are disappearing...\nIs such a thing possible?\nIt's a big problem for the country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_2_1,"...Those two are really into each other.\nI can understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_3_1,"Isn't that the place where there was a big bonfire\nthat I passed on the way to Zama Beggar?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_4_1,"It seems like it's okay to take it slow, so\nlet's go look for some junk in the castle town."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_5_1,"Mr. {pc}, let's go.\nI have a bad feeling..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_2_1,"...hey, hey, are you serious?\nThat guy named Arold must have been pretty old in my opinion.\nBut..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_3_1,"Huh? Huh?\nYou disappeared right in front of me?\nWhat do you mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_4_1,"It would be sad if the junk disappeared, but\nit doesn't matter to me whether or not a seemingly capable ogre disappears!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_5_1,"That's it! Even Mr. Arold...\nWhat on earth is going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_1_1,"I'm sorry for getting you involved.\nBut you guys are the only ones I can rely on..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_2_1,"Is that old guy called Spindle really strong?\nI didn't see it that way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_2_2,"King Grosner relies on you, so\nI'm sure you'll be in good hands...\nInstead of that, let's find Arold quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_3_1,"Sage seems to be stronger than that Spindle..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_4_1,"Pirate hideout!?\nLooks like there's some nice junk\nthere!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_5_1,"The important item you delivered to Glen Castle is\nthe\nnecklace that {pc} told you about earlier, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_5_2,"Are you saying that that incident and this one are\nconnected?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_5_3,"Yes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_1_1,"The clues are gone...\nWhere is Arold!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_2_1,"...It looks like that monster isn't\nthe mastermind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_3_1,"I feel sorry for Mr. Maille..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_4_1,"It wasn't a big piece of junk!\nI was disappointed in my expectations!\nPugiiiiii!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_5_1,"That monster...\nYou left something out that I'm curious about.\nWho are you talking about when you say you found it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_1_1,"Mr. {pc}! Please! Lend me your power to\ndefeat the Marines and rescue Arold and the others!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_2_1,"...I thought\nthat sage Sama was no ordinary person, but I never expected that he was the mastermind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_3_1,"The wise man is a monster...\nEven King Grosner and Mr. Spindle have been kidnapped... What should we do!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_4_1,"Hmm...he won't come back to life.\nSo you were connected to the former Potsucon No. 2?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_5_1,"Marine and Juliante were\nlooking for someone who had been brought back to life... in other words, Mr. {pc}...? I wonder why..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_1_1,"That voice from earlier.\nI wonder what that voice was..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_2_1,"Tch! I missed one person.\nIs that clown one of the monsters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_3_1,"I'm glad that Mr. Arold, King Grosner,\nand the others are safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_4_1,"Moki!!\nIf you're going to collect anything, you should collect\njunk rather than soldiers!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_5_1,"I'm curious about that person that the escaped monster left behind...\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_2_1,"It's kind of a carefree place.\nIs there a place where I can shake my head?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_3_1,"This is Orphea's town!\nIt looks like a really fun town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_4_1,"Looks good!\nIn a town like this,\nthere's bound to be some junk to find!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_2_1,"Hmph!\nThe leader is so loopy until the end."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_3_1,"Circus was fun!\nI even got a key emblem\nIt was really great!"

PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_2_1,"Wow, it's a\nlively place full of kids."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_3_1,"This town has a similar atmosphere to\nKeki.\nI think it's really cute!"

PT_TALK_TXT_12_20_4_1,"What a stupid trick that has no punch line!\nI have sympathy for the leader!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_2_1,"For whatever reason or not,\nI don't like kidnapping kids."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_3_1,"It's a big deal, but\nEveryone seems to believe in the leader.\nI wonder if there's something wrong...?"

PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_3_1,"Why did the leader, who is also the town mayor, kidnap\nthe children...?\nLet's go to Silver Hill!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_4_1,"If you say something like that to me,\nI don't know what kind of horse bones there are, but...\nI'm going to go crazy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_2_1,"What are you trying to say\nWhat do you mean? That leader?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_3_1,"That leader...\nThere seems to be something wrong with him after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_4_1,"That door's incomprehensible appearance\nis a bit intriguing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_2_1,"So you kidnapped them and hid them in order to protect the children from that monster?\nIsn't the mayor quite hot?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_3_1,"Captain seems like a nice person after all!\nDear {pc}!\nLet's help Captain!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_4_1,"It's starting to become a bit of a hassle..."

PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_3_1,"Captain, you were a good person after all!\nI'm sure the children will be safe!\nLet's hurry and pick them up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_4_1,"That Zaigas is a devil\nHe'll have to wait 15 years before he's defeated\nHe was quite a dick."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_2_1,"Tch, wouldn't it have been better if that group leader or the mayor had told\nthe reason from the beginning?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_3_1,"I'm glad all the children are safe.\nWe were able to defeat the scary devil, too.\nWe're happy... I guess?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_4_1,"That door... If it was protecting the children,\nI wouldn't call it a flop.\nI'm disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_10_1_1,"It's a very nice town, but...\nI can feel something sinister in the atmosphere."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_10_2_1,"...Is this the capital of Megistris?\nIt's huge considering it's the capital."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_10_3_1,"Wow! The town of Orfea\nlooked like fun, but this town too\nis cute and looks like a lot of fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_10_4_1,"...Hmm, this city is so clean\nIt's making my back feel tingly!\nI can't calm down!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1_1,"...I heard that Prince Raguas\nhad a hard time as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1_2,"Yes.\nBut now that you are here,\nit's okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1,"I never expected that the prince would follow me.\nMr. {pc}'s fate is strange."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_5_1,"Dad...\nAm I getting any closer to\nbecoming a person worthy of being a king?"

PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_4,"Of course.\nNow, please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_4_1,"Would you like to use the power of Raguas to get some junk from this castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_4_2,"Hmm. I don't think there's any\njunk in this castle that Mr. Duston would be happy with..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_5_1,"Let me\nhelp you in your battle!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_11_1_1,"...The atmosphere is disturbing.\nIs something going on here as well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_11_2_1,"...Is that a hero?\nIt certainly didn't look like an ordinary person."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_11_3_1,"...Did something happen?\nThe people in the castle were nervous."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_11_4_1,"He seems to be a hero and very capable\nI don't like insects!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_20_1_1,"A legendary notebook that can make any wish come true...?\nI wonder if such a thing really exists..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_20_2_1,"...Oh my gosh. I was put in the subjugation squad without asking\n, but I guess all I have to do is defeat the monsters, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_20_2_2,"It's better to understand\nthan to be told a mess."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_20_3_1,"King, you looked really pale, but\nI wonder if you're okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_20_4_1,"Kira Kirakira Windmill Tower means\nthat big windmill we saw on the way here, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_20_4_2,"There's definitely a rare\njunk in such a strange building!\nLet's go out now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_21_1_1,"A ritual that requires sacrifice...\nIt's kind of annoying."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_21_2_1,"...I just heard something so disgusting.\nI don't understand a ritual that involves sacrificing someone's life."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_21_3_1,"I wonder if we can do something about it...?\nKing Poopoppan\nI feel sorry for the prince too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_21_4_1,"Come on! Junk is right in front of you!\nLet's go quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_21_4_2,"Mr. Duston, do you know what\nyou're going for?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_30_1_1,"Even if we tell you,\nwill you listen to it obediently?\nBut we can't leave you alone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_30_2_1,"...I think Id was the old man who was by the king's side, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_30_2_2,"That old man is the mastermind\nIf we report\nwill the king believe us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_30_3_1,"I have to tell King Poopoppan quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_30_4_1,"I thought I was looking for a rare piece of junk, so\nI came here and... I feel like I got dragged into some kind of trouble\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_35_1_1,"I need to somehow get the king to believe that\nthat person named Id is the mastermind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_35_2_1,"...I guess you didn't listen."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_35_3_1,"What should we do?\nKing Poopoppan, you won't listen to what we say\nat all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_35_4_1,"The town and the castle are so neat and tidy\nI don't feel at ease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_1_1,"Mr. Fosteil\nIsn't your prediction a voice that\ncan be heard from anywhere?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_1_2,"...I see.\nYou were guided by that voice... So..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_2_1,"...any wish will come true\nIs it a mysterious note?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_2_2,"Hyuza, do you have a wish that you would like to make come true?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_2_3,"I don't rely on notes like that.\nI'll use my own power to rise to the top."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_3_1,"Queen Alwe\nDid you really write your third wish?\nWhat did you wish for even though you are the queen?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_3_2,"I don't know about that either...\nBut if you go to the villa, there might be\na clue left behind. Let's hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_4_1,"Will I perish if I write my third wish?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_4_2,"If that's all it takes to get\nsome nice junk,\nI'll be happy to write about it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_4_3,"If you give Mr. Duston the notebook,\nit looks like he's going to write on it, so\nyou should never give it to him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_1_1,"...It's a mysterious door.\nBut I don't find it unpleasant."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_2_1,"...Hey, hey, Mr. Hero has entered the\ndoor?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_3_1,"The person from earlier was Queen Alwe?\nBut Queen Alwe\nhas passed away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_4_1,"If you don't need this door,\ncan I take it home with you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_1_1,"...She was a kind queen.\nBut why did she write her third wish in her\nnotebook?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_2_1,"...What is that now?\nDid you see it in {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_3_1,"Queen Arwe\nYou looked so happy, so why did you write a third\nwish...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_4_1,"I don't know what you mean, but\nThe notebook that makes wishes come true\nLooks like it's real!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_1_1,"...I can't forgive that monster called Id!\nLet's hurry during the ritual!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_2_1,"...Hey, hey, is it true that Mr. Hideo is\nthe prince of this country!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_2_2,"...No. Right now, I have to beat that bastard,\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_3_1,"Mr. Foster is Prince Ragas!?\nThe queen's notebook is actually a lute...\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_4_1,"...Even the disguised person\nforgot about that!\nThat's quite an amazing feat!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_1_1,"I was able to stop Id's plan, but\nIt was a big sacrifice...\nIf only I had more power...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_2_1,"...Let's leave him alone for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_3_1,"The Queen's third wish was for\nPrince Raguas..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_3_2,"Just like my mother\nShe is such a kind mother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_4_1,"My notebook disappeared, but\nNow that I think about it, I don't need such a useful notebook\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_4_2,"Collecting junk with your own hands\nis the best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_10_2_1,"...This is Gatara.\nIsn't it a lively and nice place?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_10_3_1,"No one can give me the key emblem...?\nWhat is a junk castle?...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_1_1,"Looks like this area hasn't been affected by the\ndemonic miasma yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_1_2_1,"...Wow.\nIt's a lively and nice place."

PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_2_4_1,"Oh, my nostalgic hometown!\nIt hasn't changed at all."

PT_TALK_TXT_15_50_2_1,"...I don't know if it's an ancient weapon or something, but it's not my enemy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_50_3_1,"Junk is more important than your own life...\nIt must be difficult for Chiri to have a father like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_1_1,"This is amazing.\nIt's more like a town... or rather, a huge royal palace."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_2_1,"Is this the Dollworm Kingdom?\nI was wondering what kind of place it would be since it's in the desert, but\nIsn't it a nice town?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_3_1,"Wow, that's amazing...\nThe roads and buildings are all made of stone!\nIt's completely different from Eltona."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_4_1,"I don't like it, but every time I look at it, it's amazing!\nThis country's mechanism is amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_4_2,"I don't like it because\nit's just a bunch of useful tricks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_5_1,"It seems that in the royal family of this country, when twins are born, one of them is abandoned in order to prevent\na power struggle between siblings."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_5_2,"...Someday, if I have children,\nI would like to raise them so that siblings don't fight with each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_1_1,"I find it hard to believe that Mr. Duston has a daughter\nwho is actually the princess of this country."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_1,"This country has really been saved this time.\nI'm sure they will protect this country for a long time."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_5_1,"Choose your country or your child...\nI pray that the day when I have to make such a decision will never come.\nI want to choose a different path!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_1_1,"I was surprised that Mr. Duston's daughter was such a strong young lady. On the other hand, I guess she's a teacher..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_1,"...No way, Duston's daughter was the\nabandoned princess after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2_1,"Chiri ended up not living in the royal palace.\nIsn't it the same as before?\nThings have changed, like Duston is better."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2_2,"Moky!! Mukyakya!!\nThank you for your help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2,"Well, I don't think Duston cares whether he's royalty or not."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_3_1,"I'd like to see Poiclin in action again."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_3,"Of course!\nSuch cheap values ​​\nI don't care!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_4_1,"Now, let's go find the next piece of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_4_2,"Mr. Duston...maybe you are trying not to meet\nChiri?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_5_1,"With those three people, this country will be safe.\nI have to do my best not to lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_1,"Director Dura, Prince Ramiza\nand Chiri...\nLooks like we'll continue to get along well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_2,"Mr. Duston, are you lonely?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_3,"Hmph! Such an unfilial girl should just go wherever she wants and do whatever she wants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_4_1,"...I didn't see anything!\nI didn't ask!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_4_2,"Chiri is my unfilial daughter!\nAlways has been and always will be!\nThat's it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_5_1,"Director Dura's hard work was a mistake this time, but\nI feel like I understand her feelings."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_1_1,"The magic stone...!\nI can't believe it's capable of doing that!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_2_1,"...Hey, hey, what's this guy?\nHe just came into the party without permission."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_3_1,"I...I suddenly became a servant...\nThis lady is so scary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_1,"What is that?! You!\nYou're calling the former Potsucon No. 2 a servant instead of me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_2,"Huh? What? I'm sure Lunana's\nservant is better than an\nold man like you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_3,"Moki!!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_5_1,"It's a great discovery to change the direction of the magic stone's power and make it\nthe stone of the sun!\nDirector Dura... He's an amazing person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_1_1,"It's amazing technology that they even developed a cloth to carry the miasma stones home."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_2_1,"...We're in a volcano, of course it's hot.\nDo what you gotta do, so we can get out."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_3_1,"It's dangerous to touch it directly...\nI wonder what will happen if I touch it...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_1,"What's the fun in collecting stones that everyone wants\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_2,"You!\nIf you cat-baby the demon stone,\nit won't happen for free!!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_3,"You're such a rude person!\nI don't need something useful like that\neven if I die!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_5_1,"If we could turn this much magic stone into\nthe Stone of the Sun...\nI think we would be able to gain tremendous power."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_1_1,"Lunana is like a storm...\nLet's go back to Dollarworm."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_2_1,"...hey, hey.\nThis time it slipped out on its own, didn't it?\nWhat's that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_3_1,"Even though we defeated the monster,\nit's just a tiny stone like this\nIt's too terrible..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_4_1,"Hmph!\nYou don't understand the value of things!\nHow can you appreciate such things!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_5_1,"It seems that\nthat magical stone was sealed in Ofuda, but\nwas it really a good idea to bring it back...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_1_1,"It's a song with some kind of meaning.\nI thought it was a story from the past, but\nI was born again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_2_1,"...It's a sad song.\nIt's unacceptable for parents to abandon their children."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_3_1,"That's it…\nI can't decide between choosing a country or a child."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_4_1,"When you're a baby, all you do is cry and cry.\nIt's cute, but isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_4_2,"Chiri was fine at first, but\nshe gradually started saying things like she wanted to be helpful to her father... and\nunfilial things, which was annoying!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_5_1,"That song... I heard\nfrom my father about the folklore surrounding the Dolworm Kingdom\nCould it be..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_1_1,"You really brought it back after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_2_1,"...Hmph!\nIf it wasn't for us, we wouldn't have been able to bring back such a big\ndemon stone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_3_1,"Even though we helped you,\nyou told me to thank you...\nThat's too much!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_4_1,"I wonder why everyone would want such an embarrassing key emblem."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_5_1,"If you can really turn that much demon stone into a sun stone,\nI think it would be a great invention that could save the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_1_1,"monsters were sealed in that demon stone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_2_1,"...Hey, hey. Looks like you've\ndug up the bad guy."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_3_1,"It was Chiri!\nI wonder if you could transform into Poicrin again and solve the problem in a flash."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_4_1,"Just now, wasn't that Chiri. Come ta think\nof it, she said she was workin or somethin\nin Dolworm Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_4_2,"It doesn't matter, I completely forgot about it.\nYou're still trying to say things that are helpful to people and\nnonsense."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_5_1,"The twin children that Director Dura abandoned...?\nSo that song was true after all...\nHow cruel..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_1_1,"We were able to defeat him safely, but the rift between the brothers has become even wider."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_2_1,"...I managed to defeat it, but\nyou left something out that bothers me.\nIt's a curse, and despair never ends... or something like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_3_1,"Prince Ramiza, I was even thinking about the\nfamily of the knights I fight with...\nYou're such a kind person."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_4_1,"Hmm. Prince Ramiza seems to have quite a talent as\nwill appear after the story is over."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_5_1,"I hope that the two of you will take this opportunity to join hands and become friends."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_2_1,"...have you finally arrived?\nIt's boring while riding."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}!\nThe Ark of the Earth is amazing!\nWe reached another continent in no time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_4_1,"...Well, I slept well!\nI thought it would be convenient and trivial, but\nThe comfort of sleeping is quite good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_2_1,"...I don't know, but that ride makes me sleepy."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_3_1,"It swayed with a certain rhythm\nIt was so comfortable that I fell asleep!\n{pc}, weren't you sleepy?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_4_1,"...Well, I slept well!\nAs always, the comfort of my sleep was great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_2_1,"...hey {pc}.\nYou look pale, are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_3_1,"{pc}, are you okay?\nI think you were upset..."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_4_1,"It's still a comfortable vehicle!\nIf it breaks down, I'd like to take it back."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_2_1,"What's wrong {pc}?\nYou look more serious than usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_3_1,"I thought I would wake up and look at the scenery this time, but\nI fell asleep again...\nDear {pc}, please don't laugh, okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_4_1,"...Fuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\nI haven't had enough sleep yet.\nCan I ride again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_100_HIMEA_1,"...She still doesn't understand.\nYou can't do it alone. It's no good."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_100_HIMEA_2,"Mr. {pc}.\nLet's get the ice bird's wings before that girl and\ntake them to Mr. Foster."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_110_HIMEA_1,"...She said let's go together.\nHehe. Maybe she's changed a little?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_GARUMII_1,"Hey humans and elves!\nI won't be fooled!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_GARUMII_2,"Wow. All the kids have gathered.\nMr. Garumi... no, Garumii.\nLook forward to working with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_HIMEA_1,"...There's no way I could convince\nto return Glen Castle to the Ogres."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_HIMEA_2,"...But if it's the current Herge, I think\nmaybe."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_GARUMII_1,"...You're such a human being\nWhy... Why?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_HIMEA_1,"...Erju's plan is truly a mess."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_HIMEA_2,"But...that's why I have to do it.\nMaybe for this occasion..."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_GARUMII_1,"He's... So desperate...\nHe's really stupid."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_GARUMII_2,"If this happens, I'll see you all the way to Saigo!\nI'll create a future that isn't so cool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_HIMEA_1,"...He really came to Raydames!\nIf this happens, we'll have no choice but to do something."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_141_GARUMII_1,"...The flames have disappeared.\nWhat is this?\nIs it okay if we defeat them all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_141_HIMEA_1,"...This flame seems to have some kind of secret.\nI wonder if there are others?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_GARUMII_1,"...Chikusho!\nNext time, I'll beat you all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_GARUMII_2,"That human... look where Herju is heading!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_HIMEA_1,"For the sake of our future\nI can never lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_2_1,"...It looks like you returned safely.\nWell, I thought you would do well."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_3_1,"Welcome home, {pc}!\n...Eh? Have you met Himea?\n...Eh? Even Yakuru!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_3_2,"All I know about Yakuru is what I learned\nin the Garden of Learning, but\nI was able to meet such an amazing person!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_4_1,"So… so… what kind of junk was it from 500 years ago\n?!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_2_1,"...It looks like we'll be able to go to the Hades this time.\nThe bell is ringing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_3_1,"{pc}, let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_4_1,"It looks like we're finally going to meet Hades' junk!\nI'm sure it's some incredible junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_1_1,"That's the voice of Hades Nergel, right?\nLook, I'll definitely defeat you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_2_1,"Huh? A polite welcome greeting, huh?\nWash your neck and wait for me, Nergel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_3_1,"Fifi worked hard too\nWe have to do our best too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_4_1,"Is this the heart of the Hades?\nI have a feeling that you'll find some ridiculous junk in the evil shumi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_5_1,"Mother, Father... Please watch over us.\nIt will be over soon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_1_1,"...Nergel! Next time, we won't lose!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_2_1,"Damn...! Next time, we're not gonna lose!\n{pc}, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_3_1,"In the old days, I absolutely would have\ngave up, but I'm different now. {pc},\nlet's do our best again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_4_1,"...Hmph!\nI never give up on the junk I'm aiming for!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_4_2,"I'll definitely turn that Hades' heart into junk and bring it home!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_5_1,"I can still fight!\nI can't leave Hades alone!\n{pc}, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_1_1,"Arold...\nMy journey was worth it."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_2_1,"Ah…….\nIt's over, really."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_3_1,"Hey, {pc}.\nThis isn't a dream, right?\nWe really did it, right!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_4_1,"Castle junk!\nWe'll see you again soon!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_5_1,"Mom, Dad….\nHave I become closer to the king like my father?　"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_2_1,"...Hey, hey. That old man said all the big things\n, but he failed."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_2_2,"So what are we going to do?\nJust like that old man said, are we heading to Glen Castle Town?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_3_1,"Even with the power of Sage Hollow,\ncannot be reached...\n{pc}, what should we do?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_4_1,"The Heart of Hades... In other words, it's the Castle of Hades!?\nI have a feeling that there's going to be some incredible junk\n! Pug!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_1_1,"If you are going to Lendersia,\nyou must train.\n{pc}, thank you for your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_2_1,"Next time you're going to Lendersia, right?\nI can't even imagine what it's like, but\nI need to train hard.　"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_3_1,"Dear {pc}\nNext, you're going to Lendersia, right?\nOf course I'm going too, so let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_4_1,"Next, I'm going to collect\nthe junk I haven't seen yet in Lendersia!! Kupupupupup!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_5_1,"This trip made me realize how immature I am.\nUntil the day I can proudly return to my country\nThank you very much, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_2_1,"...No matter who you are right now, it is\n{pc} who traveled with us! It's you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_3_1,"Even if Mr. {pc} is someone else,\nthe one who saved me and traveled with me is\nMr. {pc} now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_3_2,"I believe in {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_4_1,"That stupid personality!\nEyes that don't show any motivation!\nThat's great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_2_1,"I can't believe we're going 500 years ago, but\nLook, {pc}!\nMake sure you come back safely!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\nPlease be careful when you go.\n...I feel bad that I can't help you."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_1,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\nCould you leave this guy behind for a moment in the world of 500 years ago?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_2,"Duston, don't try to make junk, it's no good...And since it's junk,\nyou'll probably get thrown away."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_3,"Hmph!\nIt's really unfortunate that people don't understand the merits of junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_90_HIMEA_1,"Nice to meet you, {pc}.\nIf I follow you,\nI think I can become that girl's power."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_99_HIMEA_1,"...It looks like she went off alone.\nBut that's no good.\nLet's hurry up and catch up."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_2_1,"Is it the Lendersia continent...\nI guess there are strong guys out there, right?\nThe sound is ringing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_3_1,"Dear {pc}\nLendersia is your hometown... right?\nDo you feel nostalgic?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_1_1,"Many people will be in trouble if the ship doesn't leave port.\nLet's help gather the materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_2_1,"If the compass doesn't get fixed, I won't be able to\ngo to Lendersia.\nWhat a hassle..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_3_1,"You can get the Infinite Magnetic Stone from either\nof two types of monsters.\nWhich one would you choose, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_4_1,"I don't know if it's a magnetic stone or if I'm going to hell, but\nIt's humiliating to look for something that could be useful like that!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_5_1,"This is what the wise Hollow was talking about:\nthe restoration of the sea route to Lendersia...."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_5_2,"Let's hurry and gather materials to go to that place."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_1_1,"Infinite magnetic stone...\nIt's an amazing name, but\nit doesn't look much different from a normal stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_2_1,"The compass moves\nwith a stone like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_3_1,"I just need to\ndeliver this stone and the magic stone to the concierge at the inn, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_4_1,"Let's deliver the stones we managed to find\nquickly!\nWe don't need anything that is useful to people!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_5_1,"I see. This infinite magnetic stone allows you to use your\ncompass even in the fog of\nconfusion."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_1_1,"What you're getting is not a boarding pass.\nYou can't exchange it unless you give the exchange ticket..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_1,"Just a monster that dropped a stone\nisn't even a warm-up exercise.\nIsn't there a stronger one?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_2,"When we get to Lendersia, we may have to fight\nstronger enemies.\nIsn't it better to save up your stamina?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_3,"...I understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_3_1,"If you take the exchange ticket with you,\nyou can exchange it for a ship pass to Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_4_1,"Isn't there a junk exchange ticket?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_5_1,"You can only receive\nboarding passes at the ship management office in the port town of Rendor..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_5_2,"I see. Only trusted people can board the\nship."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_4_1,"When on earth will I be able to go to Lendersia?\nThe junk is waiting for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_5_1,"Sage Holo said\nthat eventually I would be able to go to\nLendersia, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_5_2,"Route... Is it the port town of Lendor?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsNotOgre_4_1,"What kind of person is this brave princess who has awakened\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsNotOgre_4_2,"After all, considering he's a hero, he seems\nstrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsOgre_4_1,"That light that saved Giganf\nwas proof of his awakening."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsOgre_4_2,"The hero who emitted that light is\nbeyond this sea."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_1_1,"You're finally ready to set sail.\nI'm so excited to be on a big ship."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_1_2,"I hope I can ride with Arold someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_1,"Well done.\nLet's quickly board the Grand Titus."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_2,"We have to save the world and make\nthe kids feel safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_3,"...Hyuza is very caring."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_3_1,"It's finally Lendersia...\nWhat kind of place is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_1,"Lendersia...\nAn unknown land! A country I have never seen before!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_2,"What a worthless thing!\nWhat a piece of crap! What a piece of junk!\nI wonder if you'll wait for me!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_3,"I'm not confused, Mr. Duston...\nWhen I heard about your daughter Chiri from everyone,\nI took a second look."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_1,"If you go to Lendersia,\nyou will have to take care of\nyour uncle for a while..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_2,"But this is the journey I wanted on my own!\nWhat I have to do is not finished yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_3,"And I want to become the king of Megistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_4,"...I'm sure your father and mother\nwould like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_1_1,"I feel sorry for the person who bought the boarding pass in front of the ship...\nEven though they had already paid the advance fee,\nthey got scolded because of a misunderstanding."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_1_2,"But something seems a little strange..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_2_1,"That man with the hat...\nI felt like he was trying something against the guy who was selling the boarding pass..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_2_2,"He's a suspicious guy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_3_1,"Something this big floats on\nwater...\nIt's strange..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_4_1,"Even though I'm surrounded by all these expensive-looking things, I can't run away because I'm on the ocean!\nI feel like shit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_5_1,"Even with such a well-built ship,\nit would be impossible to reach\nLendersia without a magical compass..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_5_2,"Are the people of Lendersia safe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_1_1,"He said Crows.\nWho is he...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_1_2,"Now let's chase the red-haired sailor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_2_1,"I don't understand\nbeing ordered by a guy called Crows, but now\nI have no choice but to go after the sailors who left."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_3_1,"There are a lot of things that are questionable, but...\nBut it also seems like I can rely on you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_3_2,"That Crows guy\nmakes me feel a little confused!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_4_1,"That guy called Crows\nTo destroy someone else's memory\nis an incredible power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_4_2,"Former Potsukon No. 2.\nIf you get crushed,\nI'll make you my assistant again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_5_1,"I feel like I'm being made to dance by that guy called Crows."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_5_2,"Still, as he said, why don't you head to the first floor deck?\nIf my hunch is correct..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_1_1,"The Dark King Nergel ordered his demons to\nthwart the people heading towards Lendersia..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_1_2,"Anyway, Mr. Crows...\nIt's said that you have the power to defeat that monster in one blow.\nYou need to be careful after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_2_1,"Hey, hey, if you had been thrown into the sea like that,\nwere you planning on making us look for it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_2_2,"But, with this, I think I'll be able to reach\nLendersia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_3_1,"Mr. Crows\nwas a great person."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_3_2,"I hope there's nothing\nto do until we get to Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_1,"Are you going to sleep already?\nIf you have time like that,\nI want to look for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_2,"Looking for junk\n, old man, do it by yourself."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_3,"Gunnunnu.\nThese people don't understand the merits of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_5_1,"Who the hell is Mr. Crows?\nHe seems like an elusive person."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_1_1,"{pc}, everyone\n, thank you very much."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_2_1,"...In the end, there's nothing we can do.\nEven the wise old man can't be trusted."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_1,"Dear {pc}...\nI understand how Fifi feels."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_2,"The adults around me have high expectations for me, but what should I do if I can't live up to their expectations...\nDo I really have that kind of power?"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_3,"But {pc} and the others\ngave me courage.\nNext time, I want to be that girl's power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_4_1,"For a child, there's nothing sparkly about him.\nHe seems to have given up on something...\nThere's a lot to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_5_1,"If {pc} is involved,\nmy predictions won't work..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_1_1,"Is that the heir of Hajashu that everyone was talking about?\nHe really doesn't seem to have any motivation..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_2_1,"...It didn't seem to resonate much."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_2_2,"I guess so.\nIt seems like you were a little worried about us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_3_1,"Hehe. Fifi, it seems like you care\nabout us."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_4_1,"She's still a good-looking girl without any training\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_5_1,"I can understand a little bit how Fifi and Fuura feel\n.\nFuura! Let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_5_2,"Yeah! Let's do our best, Raguas!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_1_1,"...I can hardly believe that you were listless and just reading books."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_2_1,"...I feel like he's changed somehow.\nHis attitude is the same as always, but\nhe's a lot more motivated."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_3_1,"Hehe. Fifi\nYou're really motivated.\nJust a little more... just a little more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_4_1,"Hmm, I thought she was a floppy girl with a lot to offer\n, but I guess I was wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_5_1,"Mr. Fifi, you're very motivated.\nWe can't afford to lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_1_1,"Finally, we can ride\nto Hades King Nergel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_2_1,"Wow! That kid finally did it!\nNow you can go to the Heart of Hades!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_3_1,"You did it, {pc}!\nFifi learned\nthe Hajashu technique!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_3_2,"I can also support and\nencourage others..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_4_1,"Ah, ah...\nI'm totally motivated.\nIt's a shame that it seems like I'm watching Chiri's childhood."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_5_1,"It's finally the decisive battle with Hades...\nMr. {pc}\nLet's prepare well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_1_1,"It was fun to be on the boat for a short time.\nBut I think traveling on my own is more suitable for me."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_1,"For some reason,\nit seems we arrived at a different place than our destination, but\nwe were able to land in Lendersia anyway."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_2,"Ha! Don't worry.\nI never thought I'd be able to go\nwithout any trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_3,"That's right. It's a journey to save the world.\nIt's always a hassle."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_3_1,"This is Lendersia.\nBut why?\nI can't hear the wind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_3_2,"I don't understand what the voice of the wind is, but\nsomething is certainly wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_4_1,"Even though there is such a thing as a magic compass,\nI can't arrive at my destination properly.\n...That's a good omen!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_4_2,"Come on! The junk of Lendersia is\nwaiting for us!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_5_1,"Mr. Crows left earlier, but\nI have a feeling we'll see him again soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_5_2,"No…not a prediction, but somehow."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_1_1,"I have to go to Gran Zedora quickly and meet the Hero Princess."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_1_2,"I can't take\nwhat Mr. Crows says too much, but\nI have no other choice, so I can't help it."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_2_1,"Three butterflies?\nWhy do the butterflies have anything to do with going to Gran Zedora?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_2_2,"I don't know much about butterflies, but\nyou helped me on the Grand Titus, so I'm sure it has some meaning."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_3_1,"Mr. Crows\n, you know everything."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_3_2,"...But why\nwould you tell us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_4_1,"I'm sure some wonderful junk is waiting for me on the other side of that gate!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_4_2,"I'm going to scare the three butterflies\nI'll definitely pass through that gate!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_5_1,"Mr. Crows...\nAs I expected, we met again."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_5_2,"Anyway, it's a butterfly...?\nIs it an analogy for something?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_1_1,"Even if I collect butterflies, I have no idea how\nI can open the gate with this...."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_1_2,"There's no point in thinking about it.\nI guess we have no choice but to do as Mr. Crows told us\nand collect the three butterflies."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_2_1,"Is the butterfly that Crows was talking about\nthe one you received earlier?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_2_2,"But it's a butterfly...\nIt doesn't even look like a key, so how can I go to\nGran Zedora with this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_3_1,"Butterflies...\nAs Mr. Crows said,\nit really happened."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_3_2,"It wasn't a real butterfly, but...\nShould I just collect three like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_4_1,"Why are you forcing\nsomething of value on me!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_4_2,"I'll endure it to pass the Sanmon barrier, but\nI'd be happier if I received\nsome useless junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_5_1,"...As expected, it wasn't about a real butterfly."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_5_2,"How did\nMr. Crows know that this was available in the first place?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_1_1,"Finally, you have gathered three butterflies.\nThere were a lot of things.\nI have a lot of feelings for all of them."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_2_1,"Now that all three butterflies are together,\nthe gate will finally open. It's been quite a journey so far."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_3_1,"Dear {pc}!\nNow you can pass through the Sanmon barrier!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_4_1,"Now that we have gathered three butterflies, we can say goodbye to\nthe humiliating days of helping others and being appreciated!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_4_2,"Garakuta is waiting for you on the other side of the Sanmon Checkpoint!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_5_1,"The three butterflies Mr. Crows said\nhave gathered together."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_5_2,"But what is he planning to do with this butterfly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_1_1,"...I guess we have no choice but to go\nto the Kingdom of Gran Zedora in another way?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_2_1,"...What do you mean?\nCrows guy\nDid he trick us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_3_1,"Eh?!\nEven if you collect three butterflies, they won't let you through?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_3_2,"Mr. Crows, it didn't look like\nyou were lying though."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_4_1,"The butterflies I worked so hard to obtain are of no use to me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_4_2,"That Crows guy\nunderstands what I'm talking about!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_5_1,"I can't force myself to go through the gate, so I guess I have no choice but to turn back."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_1_1,"I wonder where that Ms. Mishua we met went\nto?\nI can't believe there are two Ms. Mishuas..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_1_2,"Something just doesn't make sense."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_1,"Mishua...is completely different\nHe's become a different person.\nWho is that Mishua...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_2,"Hey, Raguas!\nDo you understand what I mean?\nWhy has Mishua changed?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_3,"...No, I don't feel refreshed either."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_3_1,"I thought Mr. Zancrone had returned to\nthe village as well, but\nhe wasn't there."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_3_2,"Did you go somewhere to get rid of\nghosts again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_4_1,"Even though that Mishua girl has been replaced,\nno one notices...\nI'm starting to like this village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_5_1,"I don't understand\nabout Mishua either..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_5_2,"This hair ornament is the\nbutterfly that Mr. Crows was talking about...what is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_1_1,"You said\nthat we were monster's minions.\nMaybe this village has some kind of problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_1_2,"I wish there was something I could do for\nthe village children who protected us earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_2_1,"...Are there monsters in this village?\nThe siblings from earlier seem to be wandering around here without any problem. Are they okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_1,"Suddenly, something happened!''\nDo we look that suspicious?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_2,"There are some suspicious people though."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_3,"Don't praise me like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_4_1,"It's a somewhat run-down village!\nThis is something to look forward to!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_5_1,"You were feeling quite tingly.\nIs something going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_1_1,"Is that girl named Laska\nokay? I'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_2_1,"The hero of the village is going to take revenge with the monster...?\nSince it's a good opportunity, let's make a deal\nI was hoping..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_2_2,"Everyone is in trouble now that he's gone.\nLet's do what we can to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_3_1,"Ghost! ...You mean a monster, right?\n...Really a ghost\nI don't like it."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_4_1,"Is it a ghost with just a part of its body?\nHmm, it's quite intriguing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_5_1,"…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_5_2,"I'm sorry...\nWhen I was looking at Mr. Raska and Mayor Gash,\nI remembered my father."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_1_1,"You said Mishua.\nIt seems like the village is in trouble.\nAre you glad that you came with us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_1_2,"It's okay.\nI'm worried about my grandmother too.\nI'm sure Raska will be happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_19_1,"Thanks to Mr. Zankrone's words,\nRaska seems to understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_19_2,"It would be nice if you could make up with Gash's uncle and return\nto your usual energetic Raska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_1,"Hey, what kind of monster are you\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_2,"I haven't seen it directly either, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_3,"It's just parts of the dismembered body, like the head and legs...\nIt seems that it feels different from monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_3_1,"Mr. Kope,\nwhy do you live apart from\neveryone in Melsandy village?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_3_2,"The old lady is the caretaker of the waterwheel, but she's a bit difficult...\nShe's actually a very kind person."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_4_1,"Hmph! I hate things like waterwheels that are useful to everyone!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_5_1,"Laska...\nI hope you can make up with Mayor Gash."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_1_1,"Quickly fix the gears in the watermill and take\nKope back to the village chief."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_19_1,"Hehe. Grandma Kope loves\nRaska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_19_2,"While the grandmother is getting ready,\nlet's go check out the watermill."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_2_1,"She's such a shrewd old lady.\nI never thought she'd pick me up and\nforce me to do chores."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_3_1,"Mr. Kope...\nYou said something about your belly button, but\nYou're definitely worried about Raska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_4_1,"I don't want to fix a broken water wheel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_4_2,"But the inside of the abandoned watermill\nis a bit worrying!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_1,"Time is gold!\n...Those are words that make me think."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_2,"Huh? Do you even want\nmoney?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_3,"No. I mean time is as important as money\n, but the time I lost is something that money cannot buy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_4,"That's right. We also\ndon't waste our time in a place like this\nand want to save the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_1,"That numb jellyfish...\nDid you want to thank us by giving us the jewels?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_2,"But Kope took\nthe jewelry..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_3,"It looks\ndifficult to get Kope to give it back to you.\nI'm sorry for that numb jellyfish, but let's give up..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_19_1,"Thanks to {pc} and the others, we will be able to bring\nGrandma Kope back to\nthe village as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_19_2,"I would like to meet\nGrandmother Raska and Gash as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_2_1,"You're such a stubborn old woman that you want someone to steal something from you."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_3_1,"I wonder how much it would have cost if I sold that big jewel\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_4_1,"Even though I dug up the stream, I didn't find any junk at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_5_1,"Kopé, I guess you really want to meet\nLaska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_1_1,"The\nBig Room at the inn in Melsandi Village...\nI wonder what it's like?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_2_1,"What a hassle, old lady.\nBut I'm looking forward to the Bipple Room.\nLet's go to the inn quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_1,"Kopé, you seemed happy to meet Laska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_2,"That's right. Anyway,\nI didn't expect you to give me the jewels back.\nI guess you were really happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_3,"It was originally a\ngem that {pc} gave me."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_4,"Even if I received something valuable like jewelry,\nI would not be happy at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_1,"Biplume is\na rather clunky name."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_2,"VIP room means\na room for important customers.\nIt seems like they are very grateful."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_3,"Hey! You're such an important customer!\nPlease stop treating me so badly!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_5_1,"I'm relieved that Mr. Kope was able to safely meet the village chief and\nRaska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_5_2,"But where on earth is the butterfly Mr. Crows was talking about\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_1_1,"The monster that just left the village...\nIt's the monster the village chief was talking about, right?\nIf someone has been kidnapped, we need to help it quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_2_1,"I have to go rescue the kidnapped guy.\nLet's head to the plaza to the west of the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_3_1,"Even though it only has hands, it's a monster so big that it can drag people away!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_3_2,"I'm...scared, but\n{pc}, as long as I'm with you all,\nI'll be fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_4_1,"Is it a monster with giant hands...\nIsn't there a monster with earlobes that looks more chunky than that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_5_1,"It's tough...!\nLet's hurry to the\nKomorebi Square located west of the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_1_1,"Laska, it's pointless to do it alone!\nLet's chase after him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_2_1,"Raska guy, even though he's a kid,\ndon't be so reckless...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_2_2,"But I have to admit that you have such a strong heart!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_3_1,"{pc}\nLet's go help Mishua!\nI can't leave Laska alone either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_4_1,"Inside the well where a monster lives...\nThis guy feels like a junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_5_1,"Let's chase the hand ghost too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_5_2,"I can't help my child\nThat disgusted face of the Gash village chief...\nI can't abandon him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_1_1,"Hero Zankrone is small but\nvery strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_1_2,"I think I can understand\nwhy Laska respects me."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_2_1,"I guess the hero Zankrone is still alive.\nIf Laska's story is true, I didn't think he would die so easily."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_3_1,"The person who was kidnapped before\nwas also safe!\nI'm glad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_3_2,"Looks like Mishua went home first, so\nI feel safe now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_4_1,"I can't believe you don't have a single piece of junk.\nWhy did that monster have that\nhand shape?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_1,"I've reached a point of relief, but...\nWho on earth was that ghost with that hand\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_2,"It wasn't just a monster...."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_3,"The village hero, Mr. Zancrone,\nWhy is he so small...\nIt's full of mysteries."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_1_1,"Maybe the prayers we all prayed for didn't reach you...\nI feel like I can't do it all."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_2_1,"I thought\nmaybe at the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_2_2,"Isn't that god forgetting\nhis job?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_3_1,"Someday, the honorary children will be able to eat snacks\nand they'll make it into a wonderful town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_3_2,"Those guys had more guts than I expected.\nIt'll be okay...I'm sure."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_4_1,"Isn't it true that you don't make the children's wishes come true?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_5_1,"The adults in town didn't come back...\nThe positive attitude of the children\nis at least a relief."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_5_2,"Also, the\namber jewel that Lieselotte gave me... There's a butterfly inside\nI guess this is the butterfly Crows mentioned...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_1_1,"Sered, a town only for children...?\nAre there really no adults?\nIsn't that dangerous...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_1_2,"I can't tell you unless I ask you the details\nso let's go to the church on the hill."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_2_1,"He was such a cheeky kid...\nFor now, let's go to the church on the hill."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_3_1,"Queen of a town full of children...\nMight be kinda cool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_4_1,"Is this a town full of children only...?\nLooks like there's some nice junk there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_5_1,"Where on earth did the adults of Celed Town go?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_5_2,"The girl who was called the Queen had\na monster as her butler, so\nthere are a lot of things I don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_1_1,"If it's a Battle Rex,\nI saw it near the town of Ceredo.\nLet's go."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_2_1,"Shall I bring you the dragon's tail?\nIs this what that cheeky Queen Sama was talking about\nto judge the honorary child?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_3_1,"It's not like that cool queen will judge\n.\nI thought we could talk, but I'm sorry."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_4_1,"I don't want to pass the examination\nor do anything that would be recognized by others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_5_1,"You defeat the\nBattle Rex that is on the Ceredot Mountain Path and obtain the\nDragon Tail."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_1_1,"Shall I take the dragon's tail to the gatekeeper's child?\nThe Queen should be waiting for you too."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_2_1,"You have obtained the dragon's tail.\nLet's quickly go to the\nchurch on the hill in Celed Town."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_3_1,"You did it! Hurry up and take it to the church on the hill in\nin Celed Town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_3_2,"I guess I passed the exam now.\nPassed... That sounds great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_4_1,"You want a dragon's tail, not horns or fangs.\nThere's a little bit of hope!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_5_1,"It was okay because it was us, but\nit would be quite difficult for a normal adult to get a\ndragon tail."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_5_2,"Why would you go to such lengths and\nnot want an adult to be with you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_1_1,"The girl who was called Queen seems to be difficult, but\nI'm worried if she really accepts my presence in town."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_2_1,"I brought the dragon's tail, but now I have to say hello to Queen Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_2_2,"You're really excited for a game."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_3_1,"I wonder if there will be a presentation of the results at a church on a hill?\nHey...I'm a little nervous."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_4_1,"Now that I've passed the exam,\nI have to take the junk in the church.\nIt's not worth it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_5_1,"Well...I hope that now you can understand the situation in Celed Town even a little bit."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_1,"There are really only children.\nI can see how Lieselotte brings everyone together."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_2,"However,\nI feel bad for Fuura and Prince Raguas if the honorary child skips snacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_3,"I'm fine without snacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_2_1,"Those kids...\nThey seem to be having fun, but\nAre they really okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_3_1,"I wonder if the honorary child will skip snacks….\nUh, no! It's nothing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_4_1,"Honorary child?\nI don't need honor!\nI'm very happy to be a dishonorable adult!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_5_1,"I thought\nthat the town was being ruled by just children...\nIs it okay with such rules?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_1_1,"I've been inviting the adults to pray\nfor their return...\nNo one is paying attention."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_1_2,"Don't you all want the adults to\ncome back?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_2_1,"The kids are eating nothing but snacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_2_2,"Eating only what you like is bad for your health."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_1,"…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_2,"...What's wrong?\nAre you in a bad mood because you can't eat snacks?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_3,"No, that's wrong! You just said...\nYou didn't need the adults to come back.\nIs that really okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_4,"...Now then.\nThere are kids who want adults to pay attention to them, and\nthere are kids who find them annoying."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_4_1,"Is that familiar named Muccino able to take out junk too?\nI'm interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_1,"If you can command your familiar\nto give you whatever you want, then\nit's no wonder you're called Queen."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_2,"But how long can we continue to live like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_3,"I'm also curious about the\nplan you mentioned earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_1_1,"...That girl named Lieselotte\nI can't do it...I hope she doesn't."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_1_2,"She may be desperate to take the place of an adult."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_2_1,"I'm sorry that the adults are gone.\n...I don't want Saumya to hear\nwhat I just said."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_3_1,"I don't like being lectured, but\nI don't like it even more that the adults disappear."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_3_2,"Mr. {pc}, Mr. Mayu, Mr. Huza\n... Mr. Duston is also a bit strange, but\nthere are many good people."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_4_1,"Failing the ritual and erasing the adults\nis quite a bummer!\nThere's a lot to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_5_1,"Where have all the adults in town disappeared to?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_5_2,"You said that it disappeared due to a failure in summoning, but is it really so convenient that only adults can disappear?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_1_1,"As an adult, I have a responsibility to stop Lieselotte and the others who are\ntrying to do something dangerous."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_1_2,"I don't think I can stop\nLiz by myself.\nPlease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_16_1,"Liz didn't listen to my words..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_16_2,"Still, in order to protect everyone\nI have to stop Liz!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_2_1,"Even though Firo is desperately trying to stop her,\nthat Queen Sama...\nis ignoring her."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_2_2,"I don't like it when you push away someone who is worried about you."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_3_1,"It's okay, Firo.\nWe'll figure something out!\nHey! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_3_2,"Ah, thank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_4_1,"The tower you are told never to approach...\nThere is definitely some junk in this!\nGuppupupu!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_1,"We have to stop Lieselotte.\nBut for the sake of the children of Ceredo, what is the right thing to do?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_2,"The first thing to do is to stop the demon summoning ritual.\nIt will be too late if something happens."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_3,"It's pathetic, but I don't think I can stop\nLiz on my own...\nPlease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_1_1,"Lieselotte really intends to begin\nthe ritual.\nWe don't know what dangers there may be."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_1_2,"We must somehow stop the\ndemon summoning ritual!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_1,"Everyone calls her Queen, but\nLiz is just a normal child like the rest of us."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_2,"However, since everyone relies on Liz,\nshe may also feel responsible and try to do something."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_3,"Let's go after Liz!\nBefore something dangerous happens..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_2_1,"A kingdom full of children without adults...\nAt that age, it might seem like a dreamland."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_3_1,"The amber jewel with a butterfly in it\nthat the Queen obtained...\nCould it be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_3_2,"Ah! For now,\nwe have to stop the demon summoning ritual.\nLet's quickly return to Celed Town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_4_1,"I was expecting to find junk in the tower, but all I found was\na shiny ball."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_4_2,"I have to go back to the town of Celed and ask that familiar to take out all the\njunk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_1,"A dream kingdom where you can live and play as much as you like...\nIf such a country could really be created,\nhow great would it be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_2,"However, I can't believe that demons exist and can conveniently\ngrant your wishes."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_3,"Yes... There must be a reason why the adults told us to never go near Rinja Tower."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_1_1,"I will not let the children of Celed become servants of\nthe devil!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_1_2,"Mr. {pc}!\nHurry and return to the church on the hill!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_1,"Liz was fooled after all.\n...But with that demon\nI can't do anything on my own."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_2,"Please!\nPlease lend me your power again!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_3,"Well said!\nEven I feel bad if I lose.\nI'll beat you up with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_4,"Yeah!\nLet's all do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_5,"Everyone...!\nThank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_2_1,"Don't let Lieselotte's\nwish to meet her parents be trampled upon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_2_2,"I don't want to turn kids into servants...\nI don't want those stupid people trying to create such a stupid country!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_3_1,"I can't forgive the queens for being such a fool all this time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_3_2,"I won't lose to the devil who looks at everyone who is hurt\nand laughs\nagain!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_1,"I can't believe I was fooled by my familiar...\nConsidering her seemingly competent attitude,\nYou're the Queen of Punk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_2,"Rather than becoming a servant of a demon,\nI would like you to work as my assistant!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_3,"Assistant... Anyway,\nLet's help the queens!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_5_1,"It's wrong to trick children and build a kingdom for your own desires!\nI will never let you go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_1_1,"We can't fulfill the children's\nwishes, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_1_2,"As adults, we need to\nwatch over our children."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_2_1,"It's a shame to be fooled by monsters...\nThat's why we can't live in a country just for kids."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_2_2,"...It's hard when you don't have an adult to rely on\nin an emergency."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_3_1,"Everyone.\nLet's go to the Dharma Temple!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_3_2,"I want to see\nwhat Filo and the others are doing."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_4_1,"I'm not interested in temples!\nEverything is shiny and polished.\nIt's not my shumi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_5_1,"I guess the children of Celed Town were fooled."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_5_2,"Then, I was told that\nthe fact that the adults disappeared because of the failure of the summoning ritual was a lie...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_1_1,"Mr. Karevan and King Bermud were\nbrother disciples..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_1_2,"I'm sure they trained each other\nlike Giganf and Arold..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_2_1,"Seraphy and Calevan... huh?\nThey say they're going on a trip too, so maybe we'll meet again somewhere."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_3_1,"Seraphy and Chome...\nAh, Kalevan... I see.\nAs long as they're together, it'll be fine, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_4_1,"Come on! We too\nwill set out on a journey in search of new junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_1,"Monsters turned into humans...\nHumans turned into monsters\nMysterious events in this country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_2,"In the end, I didn't find out anything other than the fact that the war with demons was the cause."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_3,"But, with the bracelet that Seraphy gave me...\nIf I collect butterflies and go to the Kingdom of Gran Zedora, will I be able to learn anything?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_1_1,"Even if there's something\nyou don't understand about yourself... as long as you don't\nbetray your current heart, you'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_2_1,"Even if you forget your name or your past,\nas long as you have the will to move forward,\nthat's enough."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_3_1,"Everyone in the country\nsaid they had lost their memories.\nThey even forgot their names..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_3_2,"Me...Before I went on the journey with {pc},\nI didn't really like you, but\nI don't want to forget myself..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_4_1,"All the people, I don't even remember their names\nIt's a nice country, even though they're all crap!\nI like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_5_1,"All the people have lost their memories...?\nI can't even imagine how difficult\nit must be to lead the people in such a state..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_1,"I can't let\na bunch of people flock to one girl just because there's something I don't like!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_2,"Thank you so much for earlier!\nI just can't forgive you for such a ridiculous thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_3,"I understand how you feel, but\nDon't be so reckless."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_1,"It was such a terrible thing to point a sword at a monster that had no resistance and had no resistance.I couldn't forgive it, even if it was against the king."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_2,"But\nI never expected to make people so angry...\nThank you for helping me, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_3,"Because they are such kind people,\nI want you to see what is in the rocky mountains of Murud."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_2_1,"Did you get Seraph?\nI understand how you feel, but\nYou are too reckless."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_2_2,"But I couldn't help but feel sorry for you\nand couldn't look at you.\nThank you for helping me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_1,"The king of Arahagiro\ncared a lot about the people of the country\nand thought he was a nice person."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_2,"Sometimes monsters will understand if you talk to them, like the monster in Sui's tower."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_3,"Is that so!?\nThen, it wouldn't be strange if there were other monsters\nthat could get along with people, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_4,"Yeah...!\nThe atmosphere in the fighting arena was scary, but\nI'm glad I met Seraphy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_5,"Hehe. Me too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_1,"I think\nit's more fun to show each other junk than to make monsters fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_2,"Aha! That looks interesting!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_3,"You're a very easy-to-understand guy.\nI liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_1,"Even though it's a monster, it doesn't feel good to make an execution a spectacle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_2,"Even though it's for the sake of the people who have lost their memories,\nIsn't there a better way?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_3,"There may be a clue\nin the rocks of Murud.\nSo come with me! Please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_1_1,"A tomb created by a demon user for the monsters...\nThe monsters here were loved, weren't they?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_17_1,"It seems that the monsters sleeping in the graves of the rocky mountains of Murud\nwere friends with the demon master."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_17_2,"Mr. {pc}! I also\nwant you to see the stone monument at the back of the grave!\nLet's go quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_2_1,"A monster champion...\nI bet he was really strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_2_2,"...I wonder how Wang Sama was feeling when he came to such a place by himself."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_3_1,"Hmm...\nThere were a lot of demon users\nin this country."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_3_2,"I guess I lost my memory and forgot about that too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_4_1,"...What? Don't expect me to do something useful like\nreading the words on the tombstone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_1,"Hmm... Monster battle itself may be\na traditional culture of\nArahagiro Kingdom, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_2,"The show you saw just now didn't feel like a land where you face monsters on an equal footing."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_3,"Something doesn't make sense to me.\nDid losing my memory really mean that everything\nwas forgotten?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_1_1,"Is it a killer panther with a cross mark on its left eye?\nIf it has such a noticeable feature,\nyou'll be able to tell it apart right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_17_1,"If I am really that killer panther's\ndemon user, I can't leave her\nalone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_17_2,"Let's go to the Jaira jungle!\nThere's a cross-shaped scar on my left eye\nIf you find it, you'll know it right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_2_1,"That Seraphy guy can't use monsters...\nBefore he lost his memory,\nWas he able to control monsters properly...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_1,"He's wearing the same bracelet as Seraphy.\nIs that a killer panther?\nI'm sure they were good friends!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_2,"And I feel like if I see her again\nI'll be able to remember her.\nSo could you help me find her?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_3,"Of course.\nHey! Mr. {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_4_1,"...Are you really helping someone?\nI'm just following\nto find junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_5_1,"If you don't have the heart to accept and forgive any evil monster, you can't become a true demon user...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_5_2,"You have to have the heart to accept and forgive, not only between magic users, but also between people."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_1_1,"The\nkiller panther you're looking for with the cross-scarred eyes may be\ndeep in the jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_1_2,"We don't know what other monsters are out there, so let's be careful."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_17_1,"I think the wary killer panther is\nhiding deep in the jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_17_2,"I was nervous about exploring the jungle by myself, so having everyone there was reassuring!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_2_1,"...Looking for one monster in the jungle?\nLooks like it's going to be difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_1,"The monsters that appear in the Jaira jungle are really strong, aren't they?\nIt's a little scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_2,"But, but!\nFor the sake of Seraphy's memory,\nI have to do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_3,"Thank you, Fuura! I'll do my best too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_1,"Kuppupupupu...!\nAncient ruins hidden in the jungle!\nI have a feeling it's going to be some wonderful junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_2,"...The objective is the killer panther with a cross mark on his left eye\n, isn't it?\nI'll leave it behind if I take a detour."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_3,"Being left behind\nand being treated like junk...\nIt's not that bad!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_1,"Searching for one monster in the jungle...\nEven though there is a cross mark as a landmark\nIt seems difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_2,"However, if Seraphy's memory is restored,\nit may be a hint for other Arahagiro Kingdom people to regain their\nmemories."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_3,"Ugh. It might be a bit of a big responsibility...\nBut it reminds me to do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_1_1,"I'm glad I was able to meet my partner safely...\nI was also very nervous when Arold was kidnapped."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_1,"I want everyone in Arahagiro to understand that all monsters are not enemies."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_2,"For that purpose, first of all, let's go back to Arahagiro and make them aware of the existence of\nthe Demon User!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_3,"Chome and I will prove to everyone that humans and monsters can\ncommunicate with each other!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_2_1,"This is a fine killer panther.\nThis guy looks strong!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_3_1,"When I called you Chome, you seemed a little dissatisfied, but...\nIs that okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_3_2,"But I'm glad you found me safely!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_4_1,"That killer panther called Chome\nseems smarter than Potsukon\n, but it's not to my liking."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_1,"If you don't have the heart to accept and forgive\nno matter how brutal the monster is,\nyou won't be able to become a true demon user..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_2,"As written on the stone monument on Murud's rocky mountain,\nSeraphi, as a true magician, communicated with Chome."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_3,"I hope that Seraphi's feelings will be conveyed to\nKing Bermud and the others."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_1_1,"I think it would be terrible to force\nmonsters to fight each other until there is only one last one left."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_1_2,"We must stop such a stupid event\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_1,"Survival deathmatch...\nThe lives of monsters entertain humans\nThey're not tools..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_2,"I don't want\nmonsters to suffer because of such a cruel event!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_3,"Let's hurry to the entrance to the\nmonster fighting arena on the east side of Arahagiro!\nWe have to let the monsters escape!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_2_1,"Before the monsters hurt each other and die, let's hurry to\nthe monster-only entrance east of\nArahagiro!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_3_1,"It's terrible to make\nfight to the death just because it's a monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_3_2,"I came to tell you that humans and monsters can become friends!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_4_1,"I'm sure\nthere's good junk in places you can't normally go into!\nI'm going to the side entrance of the fighting arena!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_1,"Why did King Bermud, who was said to have come to the monsters' grave\n, do such a terrible thing...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_2,"Does it have something to do with people losing their memories?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_3,"I don't know, but...\nAnyway, we have to help the monsters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_1_1,"If Seraphy's strategy is successful,\nthe monsters will also be saved."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_1_2,"...I can't allow you to lock me up\nin order to make you fight to the death."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_17_1,"If we can successfully let the monsters in the fighting arena escape, we can cancel the\nevent!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_17_2,"If you show your coffin to the soldier guarding the side entrance and tell him\nthat you've captured a killer panther,\nhe'll let you through the underground cage."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_2_1,"I can't abandon someone I know is going to die."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_2_2,"As a monster, Chome probably thinks so too."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_1,"I wonder if they'll find out if I lie...?\nBut I don't think someone like {pc} would lie."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_2,"You look like you're flat."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_3,"I...I didn't mean that!\nMr. {pc}!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_4_1,"Is the former Potsucon No. 2 capable of deceiving people?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_4_2,"If you say that, I don't think any of us\nwould be able to lie well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_5_1,"I'm reluctant to lie, but...\nI have no choice but to avoid casualties."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_1_1,"Seraphy, I see you remembered something.\nSince you've come this far,\nI'll be with you until the end!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_1_2,"So…\nDon't be so reckless as to risk your life!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_17_1,"Please, everyone!\nLend me your power to stop Bermud!\nThat person should be in the battle hall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_2_1,"Hey, Seraphy!\nAll of a sudden, your life might be on the line\nWhat is that!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_2_2,"Sorry!\nMore details later!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_1,"{pc}!\nLet's go together with Seraphy to stop the king!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_2,"Thank you...! When you open the door near Ori's room where the monsters were captured, there is an elevator that takes you to the battle hall."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_3,"Bermud should be there now...\nEveryone please!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_4_1,"I couldn't believe I was fooled by the former Potsukon No. 2's clumsy acting.\nI really liked that soldier!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_5_1,"Seraphi\nIt's definitely not a good idea to go alone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_5_2,"Uh...Yeah, sorry.\nBut I have to hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_1_1,"Mr. Seraphy, you have remembered\nyourself from the past. I am curious as to what happened\n, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_1_2,"The first thing we need to do now is stop King Bermud.\nMr. Seraphy should be waiting for us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_2_1,"Wasn't King Bermud human?\nI can't believe he could change into the form of a monster like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_2_2,"Anyway, I'm worried about Seraphy.\n{pc}! Hurry up,\nI'm going to destroy King Bermud!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! Mr. Seraphy is missing!\n...Maybe he is trying to stop King Bermud by himself\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_3_2,"If that's the case, I need to help you quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_4_1,"I can't believe that the monsters I let go\nare actually helping me...\nIt's really nice to be so sloppy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_4_2,"Come on!\nI'll go back to collect the floppy girl!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_5_1,"That appearance of King Bermud...\nI felt a very deceptive power."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_5_2,"I can't leave Seraphi alone!\nLet's head to the battle hall of the fighting arena!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_1_1,"I was able to cancel the survival deathmatch, but\nI couldn't save King Bermud..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_1_2,"Anyway, Seraphy was\na hoimi slime..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_2_1,"Seraphy thanked me, but\nI don't know if this was a good thing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_2_2,"If you have the will to become a king,\nthink about protecting the monsters first...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_1,"Is Seraphy a hoimi slime?\nBut it seems true that he is Chome's partner...\nRaguas, do you understand?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_2,"Yeah, probably...\nHowever, it would be better to hear from Seraphy directly."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_3,"Seraphi is waiting for you at the stone monument of the demon charmer on Murud's Rock Mountain."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_4_1,"It's ridiculous\nto risk your life for revenge!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_4_2,"However, I wouldn't waste my life in the least for junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_5_1,"When King Bermud took on the form of a monster,\nhe said that it was the power he had accumulated from that person."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_5_2,"Who are they and why?\nThere are so many things I don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_1_1,"Finally, the Kingdom of Gran Zedora.\nLet's brace ourselves."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_1,"Hey, hey, why was Mishua able to pass through\nwithout being stopped by the gatekeeper?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_2,"Who is Mishua...?\nI don't even know what the three butterflies mean\nAnd Crows just happened to show up..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_3,"I don't understand it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_3_1,"Got it!\nNow you can go to the Kingdom of Gran Zedora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_3_2,"But the three butterflies don't seem to be related...?\nI gave them to Mr. Crows, but\nhe didn't use them for anything, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_4_1,"Next up is the junk from the Kingdom of Gran Zedora!\nGuppupupupu... I'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_5_1,"...Mr. Crows seems to have known from the beginning\nthat the gate would be passable."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_5_2,"That was like..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_11_3_1,"Gran Zedora Castle is so big!\nWhich castle is more magnificent among the five continents?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_11_3_2,"The quality of a country is not determined by the size or beauty of its castles.\nBut this is certainly amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_1_1,"False Princess Anlucia's words... Even though she was\nabandoned by the Great Demon King, she tried to fight\nagainst that fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_1_2,"Maybe she was also a victim of the Great Demon King\nand didn't even know it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_2_1,"I'm surprised... To think that since we came to\nLendersia, everything has been something made up by\nthe Great Demon King or whatever."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_2_2,"Even then... The people we've met so far...\nThey didn't seem fake at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_3_1,"Raska, Firo, Seraphy, up to now all the people in the\ntowns and villages we've been to; they all created\nby the Great Demon King...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_4_1,"Is this Lendersia a fake...? Everything was junk,\nyou're saying?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_4_2,"Then, the one who made it, that Great Demon King guy,\nunexpectedly likes junk, right!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_5_1,"False Lendersia... That is what the indescribable\nmalaise I have felt up to now has been."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_5_2,"To think that this entire continent and all the\npeople living upon it were wholly fabrications, how\nin the world does one have that much power..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_1,"Great Demon King Madesagora... Created False Lendersia\nto play with the people living there like toys."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_2,"...There are some things that bother me, but first\nwe must return to True Gran Zedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_3,"In Gran Zedora Castle's western tower, on the third\nfloor in the room where I was previously imprisoned,\nlet's wait for Mr. Crows to arrive."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_1_1,"Mishua, even after we parted, did you continue searching for your memories by yourself?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_2_1,"I don't mind Mishua going to Gran Zedora Castle, but have you told Laska?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_4_1,"I also have a feeling that the little junk I haven't seen yet is waiting for me at Gran Zedora Castle!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_1,"Ms. Mishua is a strange person.\nFor some reason, I feel that you and\n{pc} are a little similar."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_2,"I can't believe the two of you look alike...\nFinally, you're starting to become a bit clumsy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_3,"What!? No, I'm not talking about looks…."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_1_1,"The Hero and Mishua\nlooked just like each other...\nCould they actually be twins?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_2_1,"...That's the Hero Princess!\nI was surprised to see the same face as Mishua...\nUde certainly looks like she'll stand up."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_3_1,"Huh? Huh? Huh?\nWhy do the hero and Mishua have the same face?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_1,"I'm not interested in thrones, so why don't we just\nexplore inside the castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_2,"Mr. Duston. What are you talking about all the way here?\nI'll go with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_3,"Mukya!!\nDon't say things like Chiri!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_1,"Princess Anlucia and Ms. Mishua\nBoth looked surprised."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_2,"Indeed, it was so similar that it was hard to believe\nthat it was someone else's sora resemblance."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_3,"Ever since I came to Lendersia,\nit's really full of strange things."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_1_1,"The Princess said she hasn't awakened yet...\nBut it had to be the light that saved\nGiganf, Arold, and us back then..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_2_1,"Oi, that's not the story we were told.\nThat geezer Hollow said the light we saw was\nthe light of the Hero's Awakening, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_3_1,"Mr. Hollow said that the princess of Gran Zedora was\nthe awakened hero, right? What does that mean...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_3_2,"That old man likes to tell silly jokes,\nbut I don't think he would lie like that.\nWhat's going on...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_4_1,"I wish she'd've lent us a warehouse full\nof junk instead of a castle bedroom."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_4_2,"I'm absolutely not sorry that she didn't..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_5_1,"When Princess Anlucia heard from {pc} about\nthe light of the Hero's Awakening, did it seem as\nif she was somewhat angry...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_1_1,"Castle beds are so soft and fluffy, aren't they?\nAt first, I was tense, but then I was sound asleep."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_1_2,"It would be bad to keep the princess waiting,\nso let's ready up to go to the throne room."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_2_1,"To call us this early in the morning,\nthe Princess must've liked us."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_3_1,"Ahhh... I wish we could have slept a little longer."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_4_1,"Sleeping peacefully and they woke us up\nto call us down... That's some bad hospitality,\nbut it's fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_5_1,"{pc}, you may still be drowzy, but let\nus go to Gran Zedora Castle's throne room."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_5_2,"Even if Princess Anlucia hasn't awakened as\nthe hero, helping her is our journey's purpose."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_1_1,"Something seems suspicious, but...\nThis is our chance to see what the princess\nis capable of!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_1_2,"If you are in danger, we'll rescue you!\nThat's our duty too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_1,"Killing a giant Red Dragon...\nJust how strong is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_2,"Hyuza, that's not it.\nWe are there to be Mishua's escort!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_3,"...I know."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_3_1,"Since Ms. Mishua and Princess Anlucia look\nalike, do you think if they are together\nthat her memories will return?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_4_1,"It'd be a waste to try to get back your\nlost memory and end up a piece of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_5_1,"I can't believe we would let Mishua accompany\nus on something as dangerous as subduing a\ngiant Red Dragon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_5_2,"Do you think Princess Anlucia knows what\nshe is up against?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_1_1,"It's the princess's orders, so we'll\ndo our best to protect Mishua, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_1_2,"Do you think it's really safe to take her?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_2_1,"If it's true, we shouldn't take someone who can't fight\nto a dangerous place, like where there are dragons..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_2_2,"But as long as we're here, Mishua won't\nget a single scratch. Right, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_20_1,"{pc}, thank you so much for taking\nthe time to escort me."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_20_2,"I'll be right behind you, {pc}, so don't\nworry about me. Let's head for Zedra Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_3_1,"Mishua, when you suddenly disappeared\nfrom Melsandy Village, I was so surprised."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_3_2,"I'm sorry. I don't remember it too much...\nBut I felt like I really had to go to\nGran Zedora Castle..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_1,"The giant Red Dragon of Zedra Cave...?\nAs long as I get ta' keep all the junk,\nit don't matter if it's a dragon or whatever!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_2,"By the way, Mr. Duston, what is it\nabout junk that you like?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_3,"Because it's useless! Being kinda worthless\nis better than being useful!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_4,"Huh...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_5,"...Don't worry about it. We still don't\nunderstand it well either."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_5_1,"Now that I think about it, I still don't understand\nwhy another Mishua appeared in Melsandy Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_5_2,"However, Lady Mishua here doesn't seem to know\nanything either, so perhaps it would be better\nnot to pry."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_1_1,"Looks like the princess went first, yeah.\nLet's stick close to Mishua and head out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_2_1,"How's the Princess gonna defeat the giant\nRed Dragon... That'll be a sight to see."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_2_2,"The strength to take on a giant dragon...\nOne would certainly have to be strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_20_1,"I'm afraid of the giant Red Dragon, but I\nhave a feeling that waiting around won't\nbring back my memories."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_20_2,"Just one more breath.\nPlease, let's go to the giant dragon's nest."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_3_1,"Defeating the giant red dragon...\nDo you think Princess Anlucia is okay?\nI hope you aren't hurt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_4_1,"I can't wait ta see what kinda junk this\ngiant Red Dragon or whatever it's called\nhas waitin' for us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_4_2,"Being a giant dragon, it oughta have a\nhuge piece of junk that hard to find a\nplace to show off!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_5_1,"The giant Red Dragon is deep inside Zedra Cave, is it.\nWe will need to be careful proceeding with Mishua."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_1_1,"Mishua was originally a part of the princess?\nIf that's the case, it makes sense that they look the same,\nalthough..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_1_2,"Anyways, we can't leave her alone like this!\nLet's go after her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_2_1,"The Hero Princess' quick attitude-change\nwas weird. Busting out laughing and going\non about losing her other half?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_2_2,"I don't really get it, but we gotta go\nafter those guys!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_3_1,"Hey {pc}!\nLet's go help Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_3_2,"I don't understand that Hero's power or Princess\nAnlucia's missing half stuff, but we can't just\nlet her run off with Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_4_1,"Putting together a clunky girl who doesn't\nremember anything and a junk Hero Princess who\ncan't awaken to make them useful is unthinkable!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_4_2,"Former Junkie No. 2!\nWe gotta stop it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_5_1,"...Princess Anlucia spoke of ceremony\npreparations, did she not."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_5_2,"Until the preparations are complete, Lady Mishua\nshould be imprisoned somewhere within\nGran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_1_1,"From what Mr. Dyme said, it seems that the\nPrincess is involved in the castle town\ndisappearances..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_1_2,"Mishua is in danger!\nLet's go help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_2_1,"That Hero Princess...\nWhat is she gonna do with Mishua?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_2_2,"We gotta help Mishua...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_3_1,"Everyone who met with Princess Anlucia went\nmissing... We have to save Mishua quickly,\nno matter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_3_2,"Sea Breeze Cave at Reviewle Highway is where we\ncan enter the secret passage with the key\nMr. Dime gave us, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_4_1,"A secret passage! There's gotta be junk there!\nLet's hoof it to the Sea Breeze Cave!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_1,"Even with Lord Dyme's beloved grandchild gone,\nnone questioned it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_2,"Is there something going on, like when the other\nMishua appeared in Melsandy Village?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_3,"...I believe it would be best if we hurried."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_1_1,"I'm curious about Crows too, but we need\nto rescue Mishua first!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_2_1,"I was surprised when that Crows guy showed\nup outta nowhere, but... No point in worrying\nabout it. Now, let's get to Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_1,"Crows, he came to tell us something again,\ndidn't he..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_2,"More importantly, let us focus on getting\nthrough the secret passageway and saving\nMishua."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_3,"Yeah. You're right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_4_1,"That Crows man following us around so\naimlessly is surprisingly useless, ain't he!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_4_2,"...Gmmmm? Could it be that he's after my junk!?\nI won't allow it! I won't allow it!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_5_1,"Seabreeze Cave... It's a secret passage,\nso we don't know what may be inside.\nLet's proceed with caution."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_1_1,"Were those mages involved in King Bermud\nbecoming a monster in Arahagiro Kingdom!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_1_2,"There's no way... No way, I can't forgive that!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_2_1,"Looks like that dodgy geezer just disappeared!\nNow's the time to go save Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_2_2,"Yeah! I'm worried about Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_3_1,"They said Mishua was the experiment!?\nLet's hurry and help Mishua, before\nsomething happens to her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_4_1,"Where's that clumsy girl? Keep an eye for\njunk while you're looking for her, okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_5_1,"When King Bermud became a monster, Gran\nZedora's soldiers rushed in under orders\nof the mage from earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_5_2,"Then who is the one that King Belmud said\nhad given him power...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_1_1,"The reason we were collecting butterflies was to\nrestore Mishua's memories."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_1_2,"Only one person can enter the world of memories,\nso it's frustrating to wait, but...\nWe leave it to you, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_2_1,"Restoring Mishua's memories is up to you.\nSo don't screw around, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_3_1,"{pc}, do you think Mishua will be able\nto regain her memories?\nI'll help too, by cheering you on!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2! Bring back some junk from\nthat world of memories place!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_5_1,"We collected the 3 butterflies for restoring\nMishua's memories..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_5_2,"How long has Mr. Crows known this would happen...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_1_1,"I never would've thought Mishua was\nthe real Princess Anlucia...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_1_2,"But the light is the same as the one that\nsaved us that one time...\nThe light of the Hero's Awakening!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_2_1,"Hey, hey! That's Mishua...\nNo, she's the awakened princess!?\nI hardly recognized her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_2_2,"Yeah...\nBut I feel like Mishua's face, or rather\n, her kind side hasn't changed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_3_1,"Huh!?\nMishua is the real hero princess?\nThen what about the other Princess Anlucia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_3_2,"Even Mr. Crows didn't seem to understand, so\nwe have no choice but to meet the other\nPrincess Anlucia and ask her directly."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_1,"If this ain't the real Gran Zedora, then\nit's fine if I take the junk I found, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_2,"No, it's not!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_3,"Ah come on!\nI helped find the hero, didn't I!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_5_1,"I felt something was special about Mishua,\nbut to be the true Hero, I was surprised\nto find that out."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_5_2,"However, first we need to make our escape\nfrom the castle.\n<br>\nIf we follow the secret passage in the\nopposite direction we came, we should be\nable to get out."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_1_1,"Creation Magic...!?\nThat's how the Princess plans on becoming\nthe true hero...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_1_2,"Let's head to Alltrades Abbey\nwith the Hero Princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_2_1,"A guy who kills people like that can't\nbe called a hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_2_2,"Let's fight together with the awakened princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_3_1,"To do that to Lord Dyme, who was so kind...\nI won't forgive them! That's not the kind\nof person a true hero is!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_3_2,"Yeah. Becoming a hero just for the power...\nThat's wrong and we'll stop her no matter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_4_1,"I don't get wantin ta' become stronger by\nstealing somebody else's power, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_4_2,"We're on the same page for once, old man.\n...I'll never forgive them."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_5_1,"The false Hero Princess' words...\nBeing born to become the hero...?\nAnd the Creatorium...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_5_2,"There are still a lot of things we don't\nunderstand, but it's our mission to help the\nHero Princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_6_1,"To avenge Dyme and prevent any more people's\nlives from being taken we must stop the\nother me no matter what."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_6_2,"Let's search for the way to the Creatorium\nin the ritual chamber of Alltrades Abbey!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_1_1,"Is something wrong?\nYou look like you're not yourself..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_1_2,"If you need anything, feel free to let me know.\nI'm strong enough to protect {pc} too."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_2_1,"Oi, {pc}!\nYou've been looking pale for a while!?\nAre you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_3_1,"Dear {pc}, after passing through\nthe teleport at Alltrades Abbey you don't\nseem well... Are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_3_2,"If there is anything I can do for you, you\ncan always tell me! We're friends, afterall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_1,"What kind of thing is Sausée?\nI wonder what kind of thing it is.\nIsn't it some useless junk?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_2,"I heard it has tremendous power, so\nI don't think it's the kind of junk that Mr. Duston is expecting."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_3,"Mukyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_5_1,"Are you really confident\nto tell us where you are and\nhave us follow you? Or..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_6_1,"The whirlpool of creation... So\nI must stop what the other me is trying to do!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_1_1,"The Great Demon King's evil influence extends to\nTrue Lendersia as well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_1_2,"To prevent any incidents in this world that would\ncause anyone to do something like mourning, we need\nto search for strange phenomena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_2_1,"Look for strange phenomena... Telling us something\nvague and asking whether or not we can handle it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_2_2,"We know that Great Demon King guy is scheming\nsomething, but... It feels like we might be in a\nbit too over our heads."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_1,"True Melsandy, Celed, and Arahagiro..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_2,"Up to now, the people we've come to meet haven't\nbeen of this world, have they?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_3,"That's a little lonely, isn't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_4_1,"This time, I'll find some real junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_4_2,"Can junk be fake or real...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_5_1,"This True Lendersia and False Lendersia...\nWhat sort of connection do you suppose they have?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_5_2,"If we go to the True World's Melsandy, Celed, and\nArahagiro, perhaps we will discover something we do\nnot know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_6_1,"{pc}... Thanks to you all, I was able to\nsee my father and mother again. Truly, thank you\nso much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_6_2,"And as friends traveling together, please take care\nof me in the future."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_1_1,"To think she lost all memory while in the False\nWorld... Let's take her to her big brother's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_2_1,"When she regained her memory, she must've missed her\nbrother. Let's stop by his room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_3_1,"A big brother, huh... I don't have any siblings,\nbut I wonder what it's like...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_3_2,".......?\nWhat are you suddenly staring at me for?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_1,"Okay then, the junk in the princess's room…"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_2,"You can't go doing something like scavenging a\nlady's room!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_3,"Uggggh... That's no fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_5_1,"...We have lost far too many people to the Great\nDemon King and the Netherlord. Prince Toma being\none of them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_6_1,"Big Brother's room is on the third floor of Gran\nZedora Castle's eastern tower."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_6_2,"In the False Gran Zedora Castle, it was the same\nroom as the one you all stayed in."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1,"Who knew that those stone pillars that are everywhere\nhad such a role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2,"But with those we can travel between the two worlds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1,"How does Crows know so much about everything?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_2,"I understand that he appears to be our ally, but to\nthe extent of which he is aware feels somewhat eerie,\ndoes it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1,"He said we can go back and forth between both worlds!\nWe'll be able to see everyone from the kid's kingdom,\nand Raska, Seraphy, and the others, right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1,"Sigh... You really like collecting useful things,\ndoncha. I'm ashamed to have had you as an assistant!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1,"What is it that Mr. Crows must do...? I'm sure the\ntime will come when his purpose overlaps with our\njourney again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1,"{pc}, thank you for stopping by my\nbrother's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_2,"Make sure not to lose the Brave Stone, okay.\nYou might need it to cross back and forth between\nthe two worlds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1_melsr,"The False World's Melsandy Village looks almost\nidentical, but... Something feels a bit off, doesn't\nit."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2_melsr,"Please, look closely. This village's trees are not\ndead ones, and none of the houses are damaged."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_3_melsr,"It's true... Prince Raguas, you really memorized\nit, didn't you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1_melsr,"This Melsandy Village has a statue of Zankrone too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_2_melsr,"...Does that mean there's a Zankrone here as well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_3_melsr,"If he is in True Lendersia also, it's unlikely that\nLady Lushenda wouldn't know of him, but... I've never\nheard of such a thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_4_melsr,"Whaddya mean? I don't get it at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1_melsr,"The village looks the same and yet, things like the\npeople we know not being here feels a little strange,\ndoesn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1_melsr,"Real or not, it doesn't matter! Only whether it's\njunk or not!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1_melsr,"The villages resemble one another, but the people\nwho live there appear to be different."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_2_melsr,"Do you think Mishua, Raska, the Chief, and Grandma\nKope are inside?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1_melsr,"This is certainly Melsandy Village, however I...\nIt's not the village where I spent time as Mishua.\nThis is an awfully strange feeling."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1_serer,"Mr. Duston was quick to notice how that girl takes\nafter Lieselotte."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2_serer,"It feels like take no notice of anything but junk,\nalthough, surprisingly, you may be perfect at\nreading people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_3_serer,"Mukya!? Did you just compliment me!? Please quit it!\nIt's giving me goosebumps!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_4_serer,"Yeah, sure…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_5_serer,"Ahaha…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1_serer,"The brat here looks like the Queen from the other\nCeled. It seems like the townspeople are no different\nfrom over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1_serer,"A girl who looks like the Queen from False Celed...\nJust like Lady Anlucia and the Evil Hero; are they\njust different people with the same appearance?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1_serer,"The fact that she looks that much like the false\ntown's Queen, and you didn't notice at all...\nYou're worthy of being my assistants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_2_serer,"Jeez! We already told you, we are not your\nassistants, Mr. Duston!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1_serer,"Judging from appearances, this Celed is exactly\nidentical, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_2_serer,"Nevertheless, it seems that there are adults in this\ntown as well. What in the world is the distinction..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1_serer,"Alltrades Abbey's own city, the town of Celed...\nBut the people appear depressed, don't they. How\nabout we look around for any strange phenomena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_21_1,"If {pc} protects you,\nyou don't have to worry about anything on your way to Kudus Spring in the Gyra Jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_21_2,"You are my lifesaver.\nI am counting on you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_1_1,"Wow...\nI've never seen such a beautiful white horse..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_1_2,"This looks exactly like\nfor a hero to ride."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_2_1,"Having come this far, Crows was\na different person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_2_2,"The original Shin-yi seems to be\nkind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_3_1,"The appearance of Tenma Falchion\nIt was so beautiful, Mr. {pc}!\nI was impressed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_4_1,"I liked turtles that stayed still\n, but now they turn into horses with wings!\nI want them to return to their original form!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_4_2,"The current appearance of Pegasus is\nits original appearance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_5_1,"Mr. Shinyi...?\nI'm also curious about what he has to do as Mr. Crows on his back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_5_2,"However,\nI would like to thank\nyou for leading us to this point."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_6_1,"If you borrow the power of Tenma Falchion, you will definitely be able to break through\nthe Great Demon King's barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_6_2,"Now, let's head to the twisting, strange land\nof Solaria Canyon, which has changed...\nto the castle of the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_1_1,"We were finally able to\nbreak the barrier to the palace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_1_2,"Now, let's go defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_2_1,"The power of Pegasus is amazing...\nIt has broken the barrier that did not budge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_2_2,"Well, it's finally the decisive battle.\nLet's go! {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\nWe were able to break the barrier!\nNow we can go to the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_4_1,"That horse called Pegasus...\nHe can fly and destroy barriers.\nHe's an excellent guy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_4_2,"I've never seen a horse that looks so good and is so good!\nI don't want to get close to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_5_1,"Tenma Falchion was able to break such a strong barrier..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_5_2,"I can't go with you to the Great Demon King, but\nI'm sure he'll support you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_6_1,"As expected of Tenma Falchion,\nI couldn't break that barrier with my heroic power alone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_6_2,"While you support us so that the barrier that opened\ndoes not close again,\nlet us go inside!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_1_1,"That's an annoying number of monsters...\nLet's quickly take care of them and hurry to the Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_2_1,"The palace is full of\nmonsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_2_2,"This is the castle of the Great Demon King.\nThe air also feels stagnant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_3_1,"In the past, I would have been so scared\nthat I would have lost my footing, but\nnow I'm fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_3_2,"So {pc}!\nPlease watch my fight!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_4_1,"I want to meet\njunk, not monsters!\nMonsters are a nuisance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_5_1,"There are a lot of\nmonsters in the palace as it is home to the Great Demon King.\nIf you're not careful, you might get unexpectedly injured."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_1,"Heroes and allies...\nAnd let's combine everyone's power to defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_2,"...I won't let my ally Sama do all the cool\n.\nYou can have high hopes for me even before my wedding."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_3,"Don't expect too much from me!\nI'm confident in my ability to be a jerk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_4,"It's just like that...\nBut if it's just like usual,\nI might feel relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_5,"I've come this far because I'm with you all.\nI'm not worried now.\n...Now, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_1_1,"The power we have cultivated on our\njourneys so far...\nWe will put it to full use!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_2_1,"If I lost to the Great Demon King's minions,\nI wouldn't have the face to match\nto those who believed in me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_2_2,"...That's why I will never\nkneel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_3_1,"We will definitely defeat the Great Demon King!\nWe will face you again and again!\nHey! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_4_1,"I lost to the great demon king's henchmen...\nThis kind of clumsy behavior is not the kind of clumsyness that\nI like."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_4_2,"Come on, former Potsukon No. 2! Once again\nI'll go to that subordinate!\nI'll show you my ponkotsu power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_5_1,"Today, we have\na strong will and a sense of mission to defeat the Great Demon King!\nMr. {pc}! Let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_6_1,"Demon Marshal Zeldorado...\nAs expected, he is not an easy opponent..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_6_2,"But we will stand up again and again and protect this world.\nLet's go! {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_1_1,"The Great Demon King wasn't in the palace...\nI feel like I'm being made fun of.\nI'll definitely find him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_2_1,"Damn it...!\nWhere did the Great Demon King Yarrow disappear to!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_3_1,"If we don't find the disappeared Great Demon King quickly,\nthe Great Demon King's plan will be completed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_3_2,"Are Falchion and Anlucia somewhere in\nthe Temple of Light?\nLet's look for them, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_4_1,"Now that the Great Demon King is gone, does that mean I can take over\nthe junk that was in the palace?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_5_1,"An evil person called the Great Demon King is seeking the spiritual core of creation, going so far as to obtain\nthe power of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_5_2,"I don't know how bad it is, but\nwe have to stop it before the Great Demon King gets his hands on it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_1_1,"I can't believe I'm stuck in the barrier left by the Great Demon King...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_1_2,"...Anyway, let's go find\nthe magical power of creation.\nThe evil cave of creation was the false island of Ethene."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_2_1,"If you come here, you will be blocked by the barrier again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_2_2,"...The Great Demon King is\nan annoying bastard!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_3_1,"Demon King...I can't forgive you for always getting in our way!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_4_1,"I don't know if it's a garden or a pillow, but\nI think there's some unknown junk behind that gate!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_4_2,"Come on, former Potsucon No. 2!\nI'll make sure you get to the gate as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_5_1,"We must break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor\nand rush to the gates of the abyss.\nFirst, let's obtain the magical power of creation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_1,"The Great Demon King is using\nBig Brother Toma to open the gates of the abyss...\nThe power of the hero..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_2,"I won't let that happen.\nI can't let Touma-nii become a\ntool of the Great Demon King's ambition any longer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_3,"In order to break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor, let us fulfill Falchion's request!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_1_1,"If you have this magical power of creation, you can break through the\nbarrier and go to the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_1_2,"Let's return to the Temple of Light!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_2_1,"I have obtained the magical power of creation.\nWill this be able to break the barrier of the Temple of Light...\nNow, let's return to Pegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_3_1,"This is the magical power of creation...\nI wonder what it is... Even though it's a power that comes from a monster,\nI feel a strange warmth..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_3_2,"Ah! By the way, {pc}!\nWe must return to the Temple of Light quickly before the Great Demon King's plan goes forward!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_4_1,"I'm always forced to do things that are useful...\nSometimes it's of no use to anyone\nPlease let me suffer!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_4_2,"You can't shake until something like this, old man...\nAfter you blow up the demon king's bastard,\nyou can do whatever you want, so be patient."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_5_1,"If you bring back the goblet filled with the magical power of creation to Lord Falchion,\nyou can finally defeat the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_6_1,"Even while this is going on, the Great Demon King Madesagora should be steadily approaching\nthe gates of the abyss in search of the spiritual core of creation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_6_2,"Let's hurry and deliver\nthe Mystic Goblet to Lord Falchion in order to break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_1_1,"The power of the hero Anlucia and\nher ally {pc} was necessary to break\nthe barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_1_2,"Now, let's go beyond the\nEternal Corridor to stop the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_2_1,"I've been stuck a lot, but...\nI'm finally able to blow away the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_3_1,"The Great Demon King is scary, but\neveryone is here for me, so\nI can move forward...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_4_1,"I'm tired of being shown\nthe superior qualities of the princess and the former Potsukon No. 2, but if there is\njunk ahead of me, I'll give it to you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_5_1,"As expected of the power of a hero and his ally...\nIt's amazing that you were able to break such a strong barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_1,"We were finally able to break\nthe barrier set in the Eternal Corridor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_2,"I can't let Toma-nii become a tool of the Great Demon King's ambition any longer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_3,"I may not be able to do it with my own strength, but now everyone is by my side.\nI will definitely stop the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_4,"Come on {pc}.\nLet's hurry and aim for the end of the Eternal Corridor.\nOur final battle awaits."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_1_1,"I guess what happened earlier was just a hallucination.\nI was playing training with Arold and Giganf when they were young..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_1_2,"I couldn't do the same rigorous training as adults, so it was just a game, but...\nIt was nostalgic and fun..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_2_1,"...Was that a hallucination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_2_2,"There's no way my best friend\nis still alive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_1,"It was\na hallucination that your mother was alive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_2,"Even though I couldn't ride the Kamusha properly,\nmy mother gently hugged me\nand comforted me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_3,"I'm fine now, but I just felt like I didn't want to leave you for a little while."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_1,"Was it just a hallucination?\nWhen I woke up, I was back in the junk castle.\nAnd what's more, Chiri had turned into a baby."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_2,"Chiri is just a useless cry.\nEverything is a mess.\nOh no, it was so nostalgic!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_3,"I could have stayed a little longer, but\nthe unseen junk of Lendersia is waiting for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_1,"I had a vision that I became the king of Megistris and was\nsupported by my living father and mother…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_2,"They were\nhappy that I became king...\nThey looked very happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_3,"I thought\nthat I wanted to stay with these two forever... But I have to protect the real people of\nMegistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_4,"I will fight with everyone so that I can become a king that my father and mother can be proud of."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_1,"Did I just have a hallucination?\nWhen I woke up, I was in a big tailor's shop with my father and Arold."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_2,"Then they offered me\nall kinds of clothes.\nThey said they would buy me as many clothes as I wanted."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_3,"I realized that it was just a hallucination, so I refused because the battle with the Great Demon King Madesagora wasn't over yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_4,"However, one of the things that was recommended to me was\na costume that looked like something a bride would wear...\nThat was very beautiful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_1,"The store I was looking at was a\nweapon shop with an outstanding selection of items.What's more, it was a very generous store that would give you everything\nfor free."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_2,"I thought that if I had a good weapon, I could help you even more\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_3,"I thought that even if I received a good weapon, it would be meaningless if I didn't become stronger myself.\nI kind of lost interest in it and left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_3_1,"The hallucination I had was... Keki shop!\nIt was a shop that sold a lot of wonderful Keki dolls\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_3_2,"It was a lot of fun, but...\nI thought the {pc} guys were gone, so I went outside the shop and they disappeared..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_4_1,"I just went out to ask you to carry\nmore junk than I could carry by myself, and\nit disappeared..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_4_2,"Not only is it junk, but it was a hallucination\nIt's so useless that I like it, but\nIt's a shame to have so much junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_1,"...The hallucination I saw was that people from other countries were giving away large amounts of money and\ntreasures for\nMegistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_2,"I was worried for the sake of my people, and I remembered\nmy father... so I refused."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_3,"Rather than relying on others for everything, I want to make Megistris a good country with my own hands."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_4,"I'm sure my father will\napprove of me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_1,"I had a vision of training\nin a battle royale with extremely strong people gathered on a mysterious isolated island!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_2,"Among them were Arold and Giganf...\nAnd my father was there too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_3,"There were a lot of other strong people I met on my travels so far.\nBut for some reason, they were all men."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_4,"Huh? How did they come out?\nOf course I defeated them all and came out!\nEven though it was a hallucination, I feel like it was a good training session!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_2_1,"...I had a hallucination of being hugged by all kinds of women.\nIt was so annoying that I quickly left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_2_2,"...What is it? {pc}.\nUnfortunately, I don't have the time to mess with women."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_3_1,"I had a hallucination where men were saying something that made my heart skip a beat...\nI was so embarrassed that I ran away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_3_2,"Ugh...I've never confessed anything like that before\nso I'm still really nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_1,"Third hallucination...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_2,"Chiri was a baby, and\nthere was a lot of wonderful junk...\nThose are the only two things, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_3,"If there was such a thing as a third hallucination,\nit would have been such a boring hallucination that I don't even remember it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_5_1,"That... It was a hallucination of being praised by women I didn't know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_5_2,"I'm not very used to women, so\nI want you to stop pulling pranks like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_1_1,"Anlucia is back too, so it's finally time for the decisive battle with the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_2_1,"Anlucia was able to join us safely.\nIn order to defeat the Great Demon King, we need the hero Sama!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_3_1,"I'm glad Anlucia is safe...\nAfter all, we all have to defeat the Great Demon King\n, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_4_1,"Finally, the princess has returned.\nWithout the princess, I can't defeat the Great Demon King\nand collect junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_5_1,"If we don't have the brave Princess Anlucia and\nour ally {pc} together,\nwe won't be able to fully utilize our powers."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_5_2,"Now, let's go defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_1,"Lord Falchion said\nthat those who aim for the gates of the abyss will have their hearts tested.\nI can't believe that's what happened..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_2,"...That's right.\nWas something like that happening at {pc}?\nThat was certainly painful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_3,"But {pc} and I\nnever succumbed to such temptation.\nWe can definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_1_1,"I gained a lot of power from my long journey with {pc} and others."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_1_2,"No matter how many times I lose, I will get back up every time!\nAnd I will definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_2_1,"I'm just like Anlucia.\nThere are people I want to protect in this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_2_2,"So that they can laugh and live their lives\n...I will absolutely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_3_1,"I'm not afraid.\n{pc} and everyone else are here, so\nI can fight properly...''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_3_2,"I won't lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_4_1,"Moki!\n{pc}! If we don't defeat them quickly,\nwe won't be able to collect junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_5_1,"The power of the enemy is still strong.\nBut for the sake of the future...\nWe will not give in!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_6_1,"If we give up,\nthe world will be the way the Great Demon King wishes...\nLet's go to the gates of the abyss once again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_6_2,"Release Brother Thoma\nand crush the ambitions of Great Demon King Madesagora\nthis time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_1,"Stealing someone else's things\nSome monsters are in trouble.\nWhat would they use if they stole flour?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_2,"I wonder if monsters also bake bread...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_3,"I just can't imagine..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_2_1,"Is it\nabnormal that the wheat was stolen by monsters?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_2_2,"I don't really understand, but\ndepending on the situation, maybe we should treat it as an anomaly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_3_1,"Airi, are you feeling unwell?\nI hope you get better soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_4_1,"Stealing the bread before it's baked\nYou're an impatient monster.\nI don't dislike that kind of thing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_5_1,"Helping Airi might be a clue to\ninvestigating the strange situation in this area."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_6_1,"The wheat from Melsandi Village...\nIt reminds me of the fluffy bread that Grandma Kope baked."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_6_2,"Now, let's exterminate the monsters that stole it and get back the\nwheat!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_1_1,"It's beautiful wheat.\nI wonder if the false Melsandy village had just as\nbeautiful wheat."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_2_1,"Now that we've recovered the wheat from the monsters, let's quickly grind it into flour at the watermill."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_3_1,"Now we can get all the wheat back?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_4_1,"The guy who came up with the idea of ​​turning this grass into bread and eating it deliciously\nis a talented guy who is not good at it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_5_1,"Stealing the harvested wheat\nis an absolutely terrible monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_6_1,"The next step is to turn the wheat into flour.\nLet me use the\nflour mill at Meln Watermill Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_1_1,"The story of our experience has been turned into a fairy tale, and there is a sequel to it...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_1_2,"I'm really curious, but\nit's a sad ending..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_1,"Sad ending?\nWe\nshould have defeated that monster, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_2,"After we get rid of the ghosts,\nsomething scary might happen again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_3,"If that's the case, then\nwe have to defeat the monster again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_3_1,"The mysterious traveler from the fairy tale and\n{pc} have the same name...\nWell then..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_3_2,"But we\nhave never met\nAiri's grandfather, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_4_1,"I was forced to stay at the Big Room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_4_2,"Both Melsandy villages\nlike to bully me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_5_1,"If our experience is a\nfairy tale of this world, then what is the sad ending\nthat lies ahead?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_6_1,"The sad ending of the\nfairy tale in which Raska and the others appear..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_6_2,"There may be some connection with\nthe other Melsandy village.\nLet's ask Airi again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_1_1,"I feel nostalgic for going to the false world of Meln Watermill Village\nto pick up Grandma Kope."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_1_2,"Let's all clean up the stream...\nI still can't believe\nthat Lendersia was fake."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_2_1,"I'm starting to want to eat bread made with this flour too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_3_1,"With this flour, I'm sure\nyou can make really delicious bread!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_4_1,"The waterwheels in this world are\ncrappy, aren't they?\nThat's a shame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_5_1,"It takes a lot of effort to make even one loaf of bread.\nI learned a lot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_6_1,"Now that we've finished grinding the flour, let's go give the wheat to Airi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_1_1,"It smells good...\nThat bread looks very delicious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_2_1,"The smell of bread is making me hungry.\nLet's eat something later."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_3_1,"Wow...\nAiri's baked bread\nLooks very delicious..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_4_1,"If the bread was hard and bitter,\nI would happily eat it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_5_1,"Now all you have to do is deliver this bread to\nMr. Lapet in the village square."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_5_2,"If\nno major changes have occurred in Melsandy Village,\nthat's all good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_6_1,"Grandma Kope's bread was\nsoft and very delicious, but\nAiri's bread looks delicious too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_1_1,"It's called a hand monster\nIt's Mr. Zankrone's signature line\nIt was the same turmoil we experienced."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_2_1,"What's going on?!\nThe events in that village\nwere all made up!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_2_2,"Are you saying that we actually\nexperienced the fictional world of stories...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_3_1,"The mysterious traveler\nwho was with Laska...\nCould it be us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_3_2,"But...but that can't be true, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_4_1,"What we've seen becomes a picture-story show?\nThis is quite an experience!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_5_1,"What happened in that village...\nDid they turn our experiences into a picture-story show?\nWere we there in the picture-story show...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_5_2,"Does this mean something is wrong?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_6_1,"Grandpa Lapet's picture story show...\nWhat on earth does that mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_1_1,"I'm worried that Airi is gone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_1_2,"If a giant rabbit is involved,\nwe need to find it quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_2_1,"Giant rabbits?\nCould it be those\nthat we met in the fake Melsandi?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_1,"Airi, you\nchased a big rabbit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_2,"You said you wouldn't be able to go out much.\nI wonder if you'll be okay... I'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_3,"{pc}, let's go find\nAiri!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_4_1,"A giant rabbit? That's too bad\nIt doesn't seem useful!\nI'll go find it right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_5_1,"Maybe it's a big rabbit...?\nNo, now let's look for Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_6_1,"I'm worried about Airi.\nLet's go find her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_6_2,"Where did you go?\nI wonder if anyone in the village saw you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_1_1,"Those rabbits\nEven in this world\nI think they're going to do something unpleasant..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_1_2,"Let's protect Airi and the rabbits before they\nmeet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_2_1,"It's the bad rabbit...\nAfter all, they were the ones who were bullying the numb jellyfish."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_2_2,"I don't know why you're in this world, but\nAiri might be in danger.\nWe need to find her soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_3_1,"The ones Airi was chasing were\nthe bad guys after all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_3_2,"Mr. {pc}!\nIf we don't hurry, Airi will be bullied like a numb jellyfish!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_4_1,"A giant rabbit with no cuteness!\nA square with a cave that is almost pale!\nThat's great! You can expect this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_5_1,"The Komorebi Square in this world is also\nto the west of Melsandi Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_5_2,"But in that world,\nthere were no caves.\nLet's be careful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_6_1,"There was no\nRabbani Hole in the hidden plaza of the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_6_2,"In two worlds, things that are the same and things that are different...\nFor what purpose...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_1_1,"Those rabbits\nare not the monsters that were playing pranks\nat the water mill before..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_1_2,"If the fake world is a fairy tale, then\nwhy are they even in this world...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_2_1,"Are those rabbits\nthe mischievous rabbits from fairy tales?\nWhat do you mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}\nAiri, I'm glad you're safe!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_3_2,"But he went outside by himself, so\nI have to chase him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_4_1,"Oh! You really were there!\nSnack time is more important\nWhat a pompous person!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_4_2,"I'm getting more and more interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_5_1,"Airi also\nsaid that it was a rabbit that appeared in fairy tales, and after all\nthat time at the watermill..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_5_2,"How did you get\nfrom the fake world without using a Brave Stone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_6_1,"I can't believe that the rabbits from back then\nare even in this world...\nWhat's going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_1_1,"Airi,\nI think you overdid yourself a bit when chasing the rabbit.\nI hope you get better soon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_2_1,"I guess Airi fell asleep..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_2_2,"He looked sickly to begin with.\nI guess he used all his strength chasing\nthe rabbits..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_3_1,"Airi, are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_4_1,"Mukya!!\nI ended up staying at the Big Room again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_4_2,"I can't believe I'm such an important customer\nWhat a crappy inn!\n...I've reconsidered it just a little!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_5_1,"Did Mr. Zankrone go somewhere after\ndelivering Mr. Airi?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_5_2,"It was the same in the fake world, but\nit's truly a rare occurrence."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_6_1,"I'm worried about Airi.\nHave you felt any better\nsince then?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_1_1,"He knew about us\nHe is definitely the real Mr. Zancrone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_1_2,"Is it unusual for characters from fairy tales to appear\nand that this is happening in this village?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_2_1,"I'm worried about Airi, but if you leave\nto Zancrone, she'll be fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_2_2,"Still, I was surprised to meet\nZankrone in this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_1,"I can't believe I was able to reunite with Mr. Zankrone...\nBut Mr. Zankrone seemed to be doing well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_2,"But... what?\nIsn't Mr. Zankrone a\ncharacter from a fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_3,"In the false world of Melsandi, did you meet\nthe real Zancrone?\n...Ugh, I'm getting confused."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_4_1,"There's no need for a hero who can carry one person even though he's so small!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_4_2,"That's amazing….\nAs expected from the hero of Melsandy Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_5_1,"I can't believe that a mischievous rabbit and Mr. Zankrone have come to our world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_5_2,"Isn't the false Melsandi just created to resemble a fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_1,"...Zankrone\nYou've forgotten about me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_2,"The people of Melsandi Village seem to have forgotten about\nPrincess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_3,"But we remember it!\nHey, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_4,"...Thank you everyone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_1_1,"The rabbits who\nlured Mr. Zankrone into this world...\nThis might give us some hints."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_2_1,"I need to stop the rabbits and get them to talk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_3_1,"They said they needed\njam and butter to catch the rabbit!\nIt looks delicious spread on bread."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_4_1,"Those crappy rabbits\nEven though they're rabbits, they like jam and butter...\nThey're smelling even better!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_5_1,"It's heartwarming to hear that rabbits' favorite foods are jam and butter.\nIt's like a fairy tale."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_5_2,"Those naughty rabbits aren't what I'd call\nheartwarming, though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_6_1,"The Mr. Zancrone we know is\nthe\nhero of fairy tales, after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_6_2,"But what does\nmean that their personalities are slightly different?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_1_1,"A witch brings\neternal night to Melsandy village...\nWhat does that mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_1_2,"In any case, it looks like we have no choice but to find the witch\n.\nLet's go! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_2_1,"I don't really understand the false world, the true world, etc.\nIt's such a complicated thing\n, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_2_2,"I can't forgive anyone who would cause Airi or Raska to suffer\n!\n{pc}! I'll destroy the witch!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_3_1,"Airi...\nBefore her life ends, she wants to save everyone in the village..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_3_2,"Dear {pc}!\nLet's defeat the evil witch and\nmake Airi feel at ease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_4_1,"It looks like the witch has a lot of junk!\nSo when will she come?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_5_1,"When will the witch come and\nhow will she try to destroy the village...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_5_2,"Is it about time for Airi to\ncalm down and be able to talk\nabout the witch in the fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_6_1,"We can't leave Melsandy village...\nand Airi alone like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_1_1,"There must be a key to solving the mystery in the continuation of Airi's fairy tale\n!\nLet's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_2_1,"A witch who will tear apart heroes...\nYou have to be careful.\n{pc}! Don't let your guard down!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_1,"Mr. Zancrone's body was\ndismembered by a witch..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_2,"Then, the dismembered bodies were attacking the people of\nMelsandy Village..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_3,"That's so sad!\n{pc}, let's help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_1,"My precious little rabbit got sucked in!\nI hate being a hero because of this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_2,"But it was originally\nMr. Zankrone's ear, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_3,"Then, does that mean that hero was\na piece of crap!?\nThat's great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_5_1,"She dismembers the bodies of the village's heroes\nand turns them into monsters that attack the village...\nWhat a terrifying witch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_6_1,"Let's go back to Airi.\nMaybe we can learn something about the witch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_1_1,"The witch's weakness is chickens...\nI don't know if it's true, but\nI'll bet on that for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_2_1,"Chicken is a weak point...\nThat witch might be surprisingly weak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_2_2,"...It's surprising that the witch who wants to destroy Melsandy Village is afraid of\nchickens."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_1,"Dear {pc}.\nI'm glad you found out the witch's weakness!\nBut why is the chicken the weak point?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_2,"Is it because I don't like cries... or something like that?\nI also get a little surprised when someone cries loudly near me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_3,"Huh~ Mr. Raguas doesn't like the chicken's\ncries. I think he likes it when he says, Morning has come!\n.''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_4,"No, no! I'm just saying that\nwill be surprised if you hear a loud voice nearby!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_4_1,"Chicken is your weakness\nThat's quite a prank!\nI kind of like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_5_1,"A witch's weakness...!\nAs Airi said,\nIt may be the hope that can change the fate of destruction!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_6_1,"Now that I know the witch's weakness,\nI will not let you destroy\nMelsandy village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_6_2,"Let's go\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_1_1,"Anlucia is right.\nIf you don't have hope, you can't fight\nthe cruel fate..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_1_2,"We will absolutely defeat the witch.\nTo Airi... To show\nhope to the people of this village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_2_1,"No one is blaming you for misunderstanding your weaknesses...\nAiri, don't push yourself into a corner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_2_2,"For the sake of Airi and the others in the village who are depressed,\nwe have no choice but to defeat that witch!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_3_1,"I'll do my best!\nI have to show Airi some hope!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_3_2,"First of all...what should we do?\nIn addition to Airi, maybe we should ask someone who knows a lot about fairy tales\nabout witches?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_4_1,"If it were me, just looking at junk would give me energy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_5_1,"Let's all bring\nhope back to Airi and Melsandy Village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_6_1,"{pc}\nLend me your power too.\nI want to show Airi hope."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_1_1,"I don't know what the witch will do to dismember Mr. Zancrone's body\nand have him attack the villagers...\nI don't know what the witch will do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_1_2,"Hurry up and get back to the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_2_1,"I didn't expect Zankrone to be blown away so far...\nAfter all, that witch can't be defeated easily."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_3_1,"I can't believe the chicken isn't my weak point...\nMelsandi village will be destroyed!\nMr. {pc}, what should we do!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_4_1,"I'm disappointed in that witch\nwho is stronger than the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_4_2,"Oh no!\nThis is not the time to say things like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_5_1,"Mr. Zancrone's...crime?\nDid something happen between him and that witch\nbefore?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_6_1,"I can't believe you told us about the fear of destruction...\nBut it's true that there's nothing we can do other than talk to Airi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_6_2,"Let's go back to Airi.\nIf possible,\nI didn't want to talk about this with my current girlfriend, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_1_1,"It's the\njewel that was also found in Melsandi in the false world. In this world,\nLapet has it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_1_2,"I wonder if Airi will cheer up\nwhen she sees the jewel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_2_1,"In the fairy tale, Zancrone loses to the witch, and the continuation\nhas not been written..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_2_2,"Does that mean Zankrone lost to\nthe witch just like the fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_3_1,"The jewel Mr. Lapet gave me\nhas a powerful shine..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_3_2,"If you show me the jewelry, Airi might feel better\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_1,"I'm not interested in this kind of jewelry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_2,"If Mr. Duston says that, then\nis it real after all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_3,"Moky!!\nDon't use me for your convenience!\nPlease use me for your inconvenience!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_5_1,"This red gem that Mr. Lapet gave me...\nI received it from the numb jellyfish in the fake world.\nIs it the real great crimson gem?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_6_1,"The jewel I received from Mr. Lapet...\nIt looks kind of familiar.\nMaybe it's a real soul crystal?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_1_1,"...What?! Mr. {pc}!\nHurry up and go to the witch!\nRescue Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_2_1,"You witch...I can't forgive you!!\nOi {pc}!!\nLet's quickly head to the witch's mansion!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_3_1,"{pc}! We're in trouble!\nWe have to go help Airi quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_4_1,"Witch's mansion!\nLooks like there's some ridiculous junk\nthere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_4_2,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\nI'll hurry up and head there!\nGarakuta is waiting for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_5_1,"The night banquet hall in the Witch's Forest, which extends from the Rhône Forest.\nI'm sure that's what the witch said."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_5_2,"It's some sort of trick to go out of your way to call me out...\nNo, now is not the time to\nsay something like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_6_1,"Witch Greetzel...\nHow despicable...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_6_2,"{pc}!\nLet's go help Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_1_1,"The story of the hero Mr. Zankrone will continue\nwith Airi taking over."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_1_2,"I'm sure it will become this village's\ngreat hope and continue forever...\nThat's a wonderful thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_2_1,"Airi's guy is feeling much better.\nThe kid needs to be like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_2_2,"Then let's quickly defeat the Great Demon King and\nmake sure this peace lasts forever.\nHey {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_3_1,"Airi, you're feeling much better,\nLapet looks happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_3_2,"The continuation of Airi's story\nWhat kind of story will it be?\nI'm looking forward to it, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_4_1,"If I keep looking for strange things in the world, will I be able to find\na place full of junk like that witch's mansion?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_4_2,"Now let's move on!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_5_1,"Mr. Zankrone encouraged Mr. Airi's heart\n, and the false Melsandy Village will surely be saved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_5_2,"With courage and hope\nI will act without hesitation for the people I need to protect...\nI must become like him...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_6_1,"If Airi continues to write stories of hope,\neven if the witch tries to do something again,\nthe hero Zankrone will surely help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_6_2,"He was truly a hero.\nI must continue to do my best to be worthy of being a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_1_1,"Hero Zankrone...\nHe was truly worthy of being called a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_1_2,"If Mr. Zancrone is here,\nI think we can live in peace in\neither Melsandi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_2_1,"Huh! As expected of a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_2_2,"With Zankrone's encouragement, Airi also seems to have found a hope and a dream to live\n, so it's a happy ending for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_3_1,"Awesome! As expected of a hero, Mr. Zankrone!\nAiri was safe too\nI'm really glad!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_4_1,"I don't know if you're okay even if you don't have a heart\nAre you good or are you just a piece of crap?\nI don't know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_4_2,"I'm starting to get interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_5_1,"I'm so glad that Airi is feeling better\n...\nI'm feeling better too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_6_1,"It's unfortunate that we lost the witch, but\nAiri was safe, so\nI can feel at ease for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_6_2,"All that's left is to send Airi to\nMelsandy Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_1_1,"There are a lot of things I don't understand, but\nFirst, let's go get the shiny book\nback."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_2_1,"It's hard for an old drow man to clean up the pile of rubble all by himself.\nIsn't there anyone who can help?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_3_1,"The Queen's Church\nwould have been destroyed in this world...\nBut it's a different world, so it doesn't matter, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_3_2,"Oh, don't think it doesn't matter..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_1,"Leave the shiny books\nto the former Potsucon No. 2\nI want to dig under the rubble too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_2,"I'm sure some rare junk will come out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_3,"...Hey {pc}.\nIs Mr. Duston always like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_5_1,"The church on the hill is reduced to rubble...\nHowever, the other church seems to be safe.\nIs there a meaning behind this difference?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_6_1,"It's important to investigate incidents, but\nwe can't ignore people who are in trouble.\nLet's get back the books stolen by the monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_1_1,"This is a very nice book.\nLet's take it to Mr. Drow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_2_1,"A book that sparkles like this...\nMaybe it's no wonder that monsters want it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_3_1,"It's a very sparkling\nwonderful book...\nI wonder who the owner is...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_4_1,"You wouldn't want a musty, tattered book\nthan a shiny book like that?\nIt's even better if you can't read it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_5_1,"This sparkling book...\nIs it someone's diary...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_6_1,"It might be someone's important item, so\nLet's quickly deliver the book."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_1,"The children in Celed Town are\ndead, and Lucoria is\nthe only child..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_2,"In the town of Ceredo in the false world,\nLisellotta, Firo, and others\neveryone seemed to be doing well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_3,"The Great Demon King created\nthose children based on the children who died...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_2_1,"The Celed kids in the fake world were already dead...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_1,"I was aware of what Lucoria said\nbut..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_2,"The Queen is dead..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_3,"I'm shocked to hear this again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_4_1,"Even though he's dead, he's still alive\nIs he a piece of crap or what?\nI don't even understand!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_5_1,"When I defeated the Demon Hero, I thought I had solved\nthe problem of the false world, but...\nThe mystery is only getting deeper."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_6_1,"Just as the Great Demon King created the Demon Heroes,\nhe created the dead children as false residents of Celed...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_6_2,"That's why the adults and\nLucoria weren't in that town.\n...It's a sad story, though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_1_1,"A book that other people shouldn't read casually...\nIt doesn't seem like it's just a book."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_1_2,"The owner of the book may be in trouble.\nLet's go to the mayor's house on the west side of town."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_2_1,"Does the shiny book belong to\nthe town mayor?\n...No way."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_3_1,"I wonder what\nwas written in the shiny book..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_3_2,"I'm really curious…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_4_1,"I don't care who owns such a shiny book!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_4_2,"Rather than that, if you're going to the mayor's house,\nI'd like you to show me if there's any good junk there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_5_1,"This book is written by the mayor of Celed...\nNo, let's stop digging into it too much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_6_1,"Let's deliver the book to the mayor's house.\nAlso, he might be able to tell us if there's anything unusual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_1_1,"What do you mean by Lisellotta's belongings...\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_1_2,"Lucoria... you told the mayor that you wanted us to visit your sister's\ngrave...\n...Is there a grave?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_1,"That mayor is so cold to Lucoria.\nWhat is he so busy that he has to yell at the kid?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_2,"...Let's hurry out of this house and talk to the old drow man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_3,"You might know\nabout Queen Sama's belongings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_3_1,"If you're the mayor, you don't have to be so angry with Lucoria."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_3_2,"Remembering me and my father from the past...\nIt's a bit disgusting."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_4_1,"What's wrong with a child being shamed and useless?\nWhat's wrong with that?\nI want the guy in Chiri to follow his example!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_4_2,"Oh, you're saying something a little Matomo-like\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_5_1,"The relationship between the two worlds...\nBut what on earth is that diary left behind by Liserotta\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_1,"……That kind of thing happened in the fake town of Celed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_2,"A child who is thought to be dead here is alive over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_3,"Why on earth did the Great Demon King create\nthe false town of Celed?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_1_1,"I wonder if Mr. Lucoria is\naware of the world beyond\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_1_2,"Isn't it because you noticed that you entrusted us with\nan important letter?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_2_1,"Well, we could give\nthe letter directly to\nLieselotte..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_2_2,"Now that I know he's dead,\nhow should I tell you...\nI'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_3_1,"Mr. Lucoria knew\nabout the honorary child."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_3_2,"I wonder if he used\neven with the Queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_4_1,"I'm a dishonorable adult, so\nI'll leave the useful work of delivering letters to\nHonorary Child, former Potsucon No. 2."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_4_2,"The reason I'm going with you is\nto check if there's any junk I overlooked!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_5_1,"There are a lot of things I'm curious about, but\nLet's deliver the letter to Lieselotte.\nI'm sure you'll find out something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_5_2,"There was\nthe Stone Tower of Courage just outside the town of Celed, so\nyou can go back and forth between the two worlds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_6_1,"I wonder how Lucoria found out about {pc} and the others...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_6_2,"The diary I gave you was dug out from under the rubble of\nthe church."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_1_1,"I wonder what Lieselotte will think when she reads\nthe letter from Lucoria..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_1_2,"I don't know what is written, but I'm sure the Queen will understand\nthe feelings contained in the letter."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_2_1,"That Lisellotta guy...\nWhen he heard that they had died,\nhe was angry instead of sad."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_2_2,"It doesn't seem like you're holding back from crying just because it's in front of us.\nI wonder if that's what you really mean."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_3_1,"Queen...\nYou were surprised to hear that we had died..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_3_2,"It's normal to be surprised when\nsuddenly hears about your own death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_4_1,"Looks like there aren't any\nnotable junks anymore in the town of Celed, which is only made up of children."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_4_2,"If you're going to create a fake world,\nI wish you'd put more junk away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_5_1,"It seems that\nthe monster's lie that\nthe adults disappeared due to the failure of Lieselotte's ritual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_6_1,"True Rendarsia and false Rendarsia...\nEven if you suddenly heard such a story,\nthere's no way you would believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_6_2,"Anyway, the letter has been delivered, so let's go back to Lucoria."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_1_1,"As expected, all the children I met in the town of\nCeled in the false Lendersia were dead..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_1_2,"But we were the only ones who could see\nthose kids..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_2_1,"All of the kids in Celed over there are dead..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_3_1,"The diary was an important book that connected\nLucoria to the dead queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_3_2,"Dear {pc},\nI'm glad you found\nyour diary among the rubble."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_4_1,"Not only was that diary shiny, but it was also useful...\nI'm glad you delivered it so quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_5_1,"I thought\nthat the two worlds were more than just similar, but to think they were connected like that through\na diary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_1,"A connection with your deceased sister... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_2,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_3,"It's okay for me. Thanks to\n{pc}, I was able to say\nmy final farewell to Mr. Thomas..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_1_1,"Here's the wool...I've only heard\nthat it's used for tailoring, but I wonder what\nyou're asking the tool shop for?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_2_1,"...I don't like it, but\nI'm the old man of Lucoria.\nI'll do at least a favor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_3_1,"It's high-quality wool...\nIt looks really warm.\nDear {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_4_1,"High-quality wool!\nJust hearing something like that gives me chills!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_4_2,"It looks warm though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_5_1,"Are you in such a hurry to ask\nus, even though we've only met once?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_6_1,"Mayor\nAre you going to make warm clothes?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_1_1,"You shouldn't\nworry the weak-minded.\nIt's better to keep quiet about the church."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_2_1,"About the vision of the church...\nThe mayor told the townspeople to keep quiet.\nI understand how you feel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_2_2,"If the adults panic any more,\nit will be difficult to keep them together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_3_1,"If you\ntell the townspeople about the church,\nyou might suffer even more than you are now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_4_1,"A ghost who just laughs...\nThat's what I want as an assistant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_5_1,"No matter what happens, Mayor Blato always thinks about the residents.\nMayor Blato's attitude is admirable.\nI want to emulate him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_6_1,"I wonder if this is also the devil's plan to show people who have lost their families\nillusions and make them suffer\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_1_1,"I'm sure the dead children don't hold grudges against adults.\nBut what about the vision of the church and the children's voices earlier...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_2_1,"...A vision of a destroyed church and\nthe voice of a kid who was supposed to be dead... The town of Ceredo is filled with\nstrange things that don't happen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_3_1,"Dear {pc}...\nI saw a broken church.\nI wasn't wrong, right...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_4_1,"I thought the church had collapsed, but\nit was fixed right away...\nIt was quite an experience!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_5_1,"That vision of the collapsed church...\nThe church that was in that place in the false town of Celed\nwas also destroyed, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_5_2,"Did that\nappear as an illusion in this world?\nIf so, why...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_6_1,"The children who were supposed to be dead are alive in another town of Celed...\nEven if I say that, you won't believe me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_6_2,"Can you at least believe that I don't hold a grudge against adults?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_1,"The people of the town are also important, so\nI understand why you want to hold a meeting, but\nI want you to see more of Lucoria."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_2,"I wonder why the mayor doesn't\nvalue\nthe surviving Lucoria..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_3,"I feel sorry for Lieselotte if that parent and child keep getting away from each other.\nI want to do something about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_2_1,"They are still praying for the adults who are unlikely to come back\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_1,"The mayor is always angry at\nLucoria..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_2,"The mayor also has a responsibility to protect the people of the town, so\nhe might be putting his daughter on the back burner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_3,"I kind of understand that, but...\nI feel sorry for Lucoria, who cares about the queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_4_1,"I'm not interested in the comforting incense, but\nif it makes you feel sick,\nI'll take it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_5_1,"The Incense of Peace was dropped by the\nElder Dragon in the Llana Desolation Zone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_5_2,"Since we don't know the cause of the illusion, the best thing we can do now is\nto make you feel at least a little bit at ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_6_1,"When I think about Mr. Lucoria and the\nparents who lost their children,\nmy breasts hurt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_6_2,"I know\nhow painful and sad it is to lose a loved one."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_1_1,"You've obtained the Incense of Peace.\nLet's go to the Mayor of Celed's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_2_1,"I got the incense of peace.\nIsn't it something important to use at meetings?\nI need to deliver it to the mayor of Celed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_3_1,"If there is a scent of peace, will everyone in Celed Town be able to stay away from their anxiety a little?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_4_1,"Is this the scent of peace?\nIt's such an addictive smell!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_5_1,"A scent of peace....\nIt's a mysterious scent that I can't describe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_6_1,"It would be great if the people of Celed could feel at ease with this scent of peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_1_1,"As per the memo, shall we go to the meeting hall and deliver the incense of peace?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_1,"Have you already started preparing for the meeting?\nYou're an impatient mayor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_2,"That's how strong your feelings for everyone in the town are."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_3,"In front of everyone in town\nFirst of all, it's my daughter..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_3_1,"The mayor seems to be very busy... Mr.\n{pc}! Let's deliver the incense of peace\ndirectly to the meeting place!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_1,"The mayor is rough with people!\nThis makes me\nlook like he's being useful!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_2,"That's what makes Mr. Duston angry after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_3,"...Hey {pc}.\nMr. Duston\nAre you okay with things like this...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_5_1,"Mayor Burat is very busy.\nI hope you have time to talk to Mr. Lucoria after the meeting is over."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_6_1,"The meeting place was located west of the water source, passing through an underground passage and proceeding along\nthe cliff."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_6_2,"{pc}.\nLet's go deliver the scent of peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_1_1,"That medium...\ncalling the ghosts of dead children\nevil spirits..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_1_2,"I can't forgive\nsaying things that demean children who want to meet adults!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_1,"...The mayor should listen to\nLucoria."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_2,"He knows\nthe kids the most...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_3,"You want the mayor to believe, not just us\n, right?...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_3_1,"Mr. Lucoria\ndidn't lie..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_3_2,"The mayor believes in the stranger\nmedium..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_4_1,"When I was at a gathering, I smelled a strange odor, and\neveryone looked as if they were potcon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_4_2,"I shouldn't have given you such good junk\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_5_1,"After burning the soothing incense at the gathering,\nI felt a little dazed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_5_2,"Maybe we were used by that man named Sadak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_6_1,"It's terrible that none of the children were jealous and\nturned into demons!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_6_2,"I think you should be careful\nwith that medium named Sadak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_1_1,"Is there any clue about that diary?\nFirst of all, let's listen to the people of Celed Town."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_2_1,"I didn't say I was looking for the diary...\nWell, it was a pretty bad diary, so\nIf someone in town saw it, they might remember it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_3_1,"It's terrible! If the diary is lost, the\nconnection between Lucoria and the Queen will be lost!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_3_2,"Dear {pc}!\nLet me help you find your diary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_4_1,"I can't believe I ended up wandering around over and over again looking for the diary... Not just the former Potsucon #2, but all of them\nhave joined the board!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_4_2,"...I can't deny it, but that diary is\nan important item related to the incident in Celed Town.\nLet's look for it carefully."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_5_1,"Out of the four of us, the most suspicious one is...\nNo, we shouldn't make any assumptions.\nFirst, let's listen to their stories."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_6_1,"The missing diary is an important connection between Lucoria and\nyour sister, so\nI want to find it somehow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_6_2,"When I think about what happened if I lost Big Brother Toma's belongings, I can't imagine it being someone else's problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_1_1,"As expected, that medium took\nLisellotta's diary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_1_2,"I can't believe you would take away\nthe precious diary that is the bond between Lieselotte and Lucoria...\nLet's go to Rinja Tower quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_2_1,"I can't believe a medium would steal\nsomething that belongs to a kid...\nThat guy is suspicious after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_3_1,"How dare you steal the diary that the Queen and Ms. Lucoria\ntreasure!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_3_2,"Mr. {pc}! For the sake of both of us,\nwe will definitely get it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_4_1,"This diary is often stolen.\nWhat's so good about such a shiny book?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_5_1,"Is it because\nthat diary makes it\ndifficult to pretend that the children have become demons?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_5_2,"Anyway, let's go to Rinja Tower and get\nthe diary back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_6_1,"I can't let Lucoria go alone.\nLet's hurry to Rinja Tower too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_1_1,"The children's prayers have finally been answered.\nWe will be separated again, but\nI'm really glad we were able to say goodbye."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_1_2,"Mr. Lucoria also received a\ndoll from Ms. Liserotta...\nYeah, it's okay now, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_2_1,"Reuniting dead kids with adults...\nLucoria is a big deal."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_3_1,"Even though the mayor is clumsy,\nhe actually cares about the Queen and Lisellotta."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_3_2,"...I also want to meet\nmy father."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_1,"I can't believe I only let you see me for a short time\nAfter all, that guy called Kami is a total idiot!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_2,"If it's true, I won't be able to meet the dead guy.\nEven just a little bit would be nice."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_3,"Hmph! I guess that's what it is.\n...Well, I like the idea of ​​a clumsy god,\nthough!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_5_1,"I think it was good that we were finally able to express our feelings to each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_5_2,"...But it's an invasion by a false world.\nIt seems like the Great Demon King isn't satisfied with just creating his own world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_6_1,"I'm sure the people of this town will be okay.\nFinally, I was able to\nconvey my important feelings..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_1_1,"The purpose of the medium is to erode this side's\nCeled with false Celed..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_1_2,"I can't forgive you for\ndeceiving everyone in town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_2_1,"I can't forgive that Sadak bastard!\nLet's go to Celed Town quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_1,"My precious diary...\nIt was burnt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_2,"But! I couldn't protect the diary, but if you're a townie, there's still time!\nI won't let that medium do what he wants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_3,"Dear {pc}!\nLet's hurry and return to Celed Town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_4_1,"What will happen if our world is invaded by a false world\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_4_2,"This world is going to be ruined too...\nIs that what you mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_5_1,"I'm also curious about the\nmasked person who was instructing Sadak...\nFirst, let's prevent the erosion of the false world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_6_1,"Who is that black masked man...?\nNo, not right now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_6_2,"{pc}!\nLet's hurry back to Celed Town to stop Sadak's plan\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_1_1,"For now, let's go to the chapel of\nDharma Temple with the townspeople."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_2_1,"Even though we defeated the Sadak bastard,\nit's not over yet!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_3_1,"Even though we defeated Sadak,\nthe erosion still hasn't stopped...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_4_1,"A monster who is getting in the way of a girl!\nAnd a girl who is a girl and a girl who is a girl!\nIt's a nice town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_4_2,"I agree with you about it being a clumsy monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_5_1,"As Lucoria said,\nLet's go to the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_5_2,"As people who know the two towns of Celed\n, we have to witness it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_6_1,"Thanks to Lucoria, we were able to prevent\nSadak's plan."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_6_2,"But as Lucoria said,\nif the erosion is not over yet...\nLet's go to the Dharma Temple quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_1_1,"It doesn't seem like\nthe battles between monsters are really exciting here at Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_2_1,"Is this the true Kingdom of Arahagiro?\nCompared to the false world of Arahagiro,\nit doesn't seem to have changed much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_3_1,"The wind here in Arahagiro is also very hot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_4_1,"It would be great if there was also a ruin here in Arahagiro that was blessed with\njunk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_5_1,"In either world\nIt's hot in the Arahagiro Kingdom...\nI hope we can find a clue soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_1,"I have met King Moonis of the Arahagiro Kingdom before\n, but do you know anything about the incident?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_2,"Now that I think about it, even in the fake world,\nthe Grand Zedora Kingdom and the Arahagiro Kingdom seem to have had\ncontact."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_3,"However, the purpose was to use\nKing Bermud and the others as experimental materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_4,"To abuse the bond between two countries in such a distorted way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_5,"I don't know what the Great Demon King is planning, but\nI will absolutely stop it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_1_1,"Drink the water from the\noasis in front of the monster fighting arena...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_1_2,"I don't know what's inside the pot, but\nI can't leave it alone, so let's go to the monster fighting arena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_1,"You said something like, 'Let that pot drain the water...."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_2,"You look weak, but\nit's kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_3,"It looks like there's something in the pot.\nShould I bring you some water?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_3_1,"It was kind of a creepy pressure point, but...\nIs it okay to do as you say?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_3_2,"...But the voice inside the pressure point\nseemed to be in a lot of pain."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_4_1,"A talking pot would be useful, but\nIt's just a bunch of crap that just wants water!\nThat's just how I like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_5_1,"It was a suspicious pot, but\nI can't just leave it alone.\nLet's deliver water from the oasis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_6_1,"I feel like I heard that voice from that pressure point\nsomewhere...\nI'm sure it's just my imagination."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_1_1,"Let's deliver\nthe water from the oasis to the talking pot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_1_2,"I'm really\ncurious about what's inside the pressure points..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_2_1,"The guy in the pot\nwas making a pretty painful voice\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_2_2,"{pc}. Let's go ahead and bring you\nsome water."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_3_1,"I wonder what\nis inside the pressure points...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_3_2,"I didn't see any bad signs.\nTake some water from the oasis and\nI hope you find out who it is...''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_4_1,"That stupid pressure point that wants water...\nIsn't it a bad idea to just take it home?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_5_1,"I feel bad about using the precious oasis water for\nan unknown black mass, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_5_2,"It may be a clue to investigating the abnormalities in the Arahagiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_6_1,"I got the water as you asked, but\nI wonder what's in that pot?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_6_2,"The voice I heard from the pressure point...\nI feel like I heard it somewhere...\nHmm, I wonder where it was?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_1_1,"If such a big seaweed monster went to\nthe castle, wouldn't it cause a big fuss...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_1_2,"I'm a little worried.\nLet's go after you, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_2_1,"...The monster called itself King Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_2_2,"I went back to my country...\nIs it okay for me to go back like that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_1,"There is a king inside the pot\nThe king is a seaweed monster...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_2,"That seaweed monster king\nsaid he was going back to the castle!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_3,"{pc}, can I leave you alone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_4_1,"Come on! Hurry up and follow that seaweed\n!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_5_1,"Hello...I'm glad to see that you didn't dry up like that and recovered."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_1,"I met King Moonis when I was still small."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_2,"Even though we are the same king, I still remember thinking that\nyou and my father are very different."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_3,"I feel like that monster's personality and voice\nresembled King Moonis at that time\n, but... I wonder if it's real?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_1_1,"If you're calling Mr. {pc}'s name,\nit's definitely the monster that came out of that pressure point."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_2_1,"The monster the minister is talking about is\nthe one who calls himself King Sama\n, isn't he talking about wakame...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_2_2,"If it's that wakame monster,\nit's only natural that there will be an uproar..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_3_1,"I'm just calling out {pc}'s name, so\nthe seaweed monster king\nmust have been in a lot of trouble..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_1,"I'm sure it's that seaweed!\nIt's a nice chunk that won't disappoint!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_2,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\nI'm so jealous that you like me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_3,"Come on!\nFrom the side entrance of the fighting arena\nI'll go see Wakame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_4,"Hey {pc}...\nIsn't Duston's enthusiasm\na bit unique...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_5_1,"The one calling {pc} is\nthat seaweed king,\nI'm glad he hasn't been exterminated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_6_1,"Did that seaweed monster\njust enter the Arahagiro Kingdom and get captured?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_6_2,"I feel like the King Moonis I know would do\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_1_1,"You seem to be in trouble because you can't prove that you're the king\n, so let's get the king's crown back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_1_2,"Regardless of whether he's really the king or not,\nI feel a little guilty about keeping him locked up like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_1,"If the wakame monster is King Sama,\nI don't think anyone would believe me in my monster form..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_2,"If you don't get the King Shaku back,\nKing, he won't be able to get out of the cage!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_3,"Even if it's a monster, the country needs a king.\nShall we go get the king back?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_3_1,"If Wakame remains as it is now, no one will believe that he is the king."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_3_2,"I still can't believe it either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_4_1,"If I say I'm going to take it,\ncould you please let that wakame king out of\nthe cage?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_4_2,"...Doesn't that mean you'll be taking\nwith us on our journey?\nPlease give me a break from that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_5_1,"I knew about the king, so I guess he really is the king of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_5_2,"Maybe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_6_1,"Indeed, the real King Moonis also\nhad a golden talisman.\nThen, after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_6_2,"{pc}.\nLet's go to the south of the Arahagiro region and retrieve\nthe king shank."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_1_1,"I hope the people of Arahagiro Kingdom will believe that\nI got it back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_2_1,"You've got the Kingfisher back.\nThen let's take it to that seaweed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_3_1,"If you have a king, everyone will believe that you are the king, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_3_2,"Hurry up and deliver\nto the basement of the fighting arena!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_4_1,"It's a shiny, shiny piece of wood!\nThat doesn't suit Wakame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_5_1,"Well, it's great that we got the king shank back, but\nwill you now believe that\nis the real King Moonis?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_6_1,"Let's deliver the golden talisman to\nKing Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_6_2,"Even though he looks like that,\nI believe he is the real King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_1_1,"A human who has been transformed into a monster...\nThat's a false world.\nIt overlaps with what I heard from Mr. Seraphy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_2_1,"There are\npeople like that Wakame King who have been turned into monsters and are suffering\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_2_2,"I want to find the missing people as soon as possible and bring them home."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_3_1,"Let's cooperate with King Moonis so that all the soldiers who were transformed into monsters can\nquickly return to normal.\nLet's cooperate with King Moonis!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_4_1,"I thought it was a rare piece of crap, but\nI was surprised to find that he is a splendid king...\nI'm a little disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_5_1,"King Moonis cares\nfor his vassals."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_5_2,"In order to become a fine king,\nI must follow your example."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_6_1,"Turning captured people into monsters...\nWhat is the Great Demon King planning?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_1_1,"I feel like the story went\nin a strange direction, but...\nIt was really King Moonis, wasn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_1_2,"The king is now back, so I'm sure the ministers and soldiers are happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_1,"I'm glad that you believed that wakame was the Kingfisher.\n...I guess he didn't need the Kingfisher."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_2,"I wish I could tell my subordinate's secret\nand have him believe me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_3,"It means that King Moonis watches his subjects closely.\nIn a sense, I think it is an ideal relationship of trust."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_3_1,"Even if there wasn't a king,\nwith the advice from Raguas,\nyou could have believed me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_3_2,"Either way, we'll still need the Kingfisher\nin the future...\nThere's meaning in getting it back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_4_1,"That seaweed...\nIf you didn't believe that he was the king,\nI would have wanted to take him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_4_2,"But in a country where seaweed is king,\nit's quite nice!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_5_1,"I'm glad that the ministers and soldier commanders\nbelieved that I was the real King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_5_2,"If you weren't interested in your subjects,\nyou might have remained in the cage forever."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_6_1,"He was the real King Moonis after all.\n{pc} Thank you for believing in me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_1,"In order for the king to return to his normal form as soon as possible,\nlet us escort him\nto the Fountain of Kudus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_2,"What a dependable\nyoung lady.\nPlease help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_3,"Maiyu is the daughter of the\nvillage king of Rangao village. By the way,\nFuura is also the daughter of the Azlan lord."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_4,"If you say that, Raguas is not\nthe prince of Megistris.\nLady Anlucia is also a princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_5,"Hoho! Surprisingly, you guys are full of boys and girls.\nHmm! That's as good as it gets!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_1,"Is it\nKudus Spring deep in the Gyra jungle...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_2,"Even though I'm the King Sama,\nit feels strange to be walking around with someone who looks like a monster, but...\nNow that I've accepted you, I'll protect you properly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_3,"Hyohoho!\nYou're a reliable cool guy!\nThank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_1,"Are you going to escort the king\nto the Kudus spring in the Gyra jungle...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_2,"Can I protect it properly?\nI'm nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_3,"Everyone is here and Fuura is strong enough.\nSo it's okay."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_1,"Are you going to turn the precious wakame back into a human?\nIt's such a waste!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_2,"I've just gotten used to this body, but if I remain a monster, I'll have trouble managing national affairs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_3,"Isn't that good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_4,"What...?\nYou have some interesting friends with you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_5_1,"Is it a holy spring that can remove the curse of change...?\nI'm glad it's recorded in ancient documents."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_5_2,"It's all thanks to the minister, Caboose.\nHe writes cold love letters with poems, but\nhe's good at his job."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_1,"When I saw King Moonis' face\n, he looked kind and had a charming aura.\nI hope he can return to his normal state soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_2,"I guess it's fine even if I can't go back.\nI like the seaweed face you have now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_3,"Yeah...?\nWell, I don't think that's possible\n, but... Hey {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_1_1,"King Moonis has returned to his original form, so\nhe can finally appear in front of the people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_1_2,"Now, let's go to the\nthrone room of the true Arahagiro Kingdom.\nKing Moonis should be waiting for you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_1,"Just by soaking in the Kudus spring\nyou can easily return to your original form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_2,"...she didn't look much\ndifferent though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_3,"The feel of his beard and the way it looked\nwasn't much different than when he was wakame..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_3_1,"The king returned to normal at the Fountain of Kudus, but\nit seems like he hasn't changed much...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_3_2,"What did you think, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_4_1,"It's a pity that Wakame has turned back into a human, but could you please give me some junk as a thank you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_4_2,"Former Potsukon No. 2!\nQuickly, I'll go to the former Wakame King to get my thanks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_5_1,"Even after King Moonis returned to his human form,\nhis atmosphere didn't change much.\nNot only his appearance, but also his brightness..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_5_2,"Even if you are transformed into a monster,\nyou can still maintain your happy personality...\nPerhaps that is one of your qualities as a king."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_6_1,"I'm glad that King Moonis has returned to his original form.\nI hope the other people who were turned into monsters can also be found."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_1_1,"We've found a way to get back to normal.\nLet's help\nfind the missing person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_2_1,"I guess the missing guys are having a hard time in\nmonster form, just like\nKing Sama..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_3_1,"I hope the missing\nsoldiers like King Moonis can be reunited."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_4_1,"Soldiers and demon users who have been turned into monsters...\nMugugu...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_4_2,"Well, it doesn't matter!\nRather than that, let's look for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_5_1,"King Moonis is a very considerate person.\nI guess that's why you want to support him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_6_1,"Do you have any more information\nabout the missing soldiers?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_6_2,"If I meet King Moonis again,\nI might be able to ask him something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_1_1,"When I hear Maleika's story,\nI want to meet\n Kalevan as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_1_2,"I feel like\nthe same person I was when Arold was gone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_1,"Kalevan the Demon Wizard...I think\nis the name of the killer panther who is with Seraphi when he was\na human."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_2,"I think you should tell\nSeraphy what you heard from King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_3,"I have no choice but to go to Arahagiro over there and meet\nSeraphy and the others."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_3_1,"The monster with the cross-shaped scar on its left eye is...\nMr. Kalevan, the killer panther, who is with Mr. Seraphy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_3_2,"Dear {pc}!\nLet's go to the false world of Arahagiro Kingdom!\nLet's go meet Seraphy and the others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_4_1,"Karevan...?\nIf you're not a piece of crap, I'm not interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_5_1,"It's a monster with a cross mark on its left eye.\nHis name is Kalevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_5_2,"I don't think it has anything to do with the events of the fake Arahagiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_1,"Everyone seems to have something in mind\nabout Mr. Calevan.\nCould you tell me too?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_2,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_3,"...Yes.\nSomething like that happened in the fake Arahagiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_4,"Let's meet\nSeraphy and the others who are said to be in the fake Arahagiro Kingdom and find out\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_1_1,"I want to let your wife and children meet\nMr. Kaleven as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_1_2,"Let's go to\nStone Tower of Courage in front of the false Kingdom of Arahagiro!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_2_1,"Are you going to\nStone Tower of Courage in front of Arahagiro Kingdom?\nLet's go quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_2_2,"We need to bring Seraphi and the others back to the true world as soon as possible.\nKalevan's family is waiting for their return."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}! I will help\nMr. Calevan meet his family as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_4_1,"There are all kinds of junk lying around near the Arahagiro Kingdom.\nI like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_5_1,"The only thing left to do is take Karevan back to\nthe true Kingdom of Arahagiro and\nlift the curse."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_5_2,"Now that I think about it, Seraphy was also\noriginally a hoimi slime.\nWill Seraphy's curse be broken as well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_6_1,"The\nBrave Stone will be useful in bringing Karevan and the others back to\nthe true Arahagiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_6_2,"Now, let's quickly go to the\nStone Tower of Courage in front of the false Kingdom of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_1_1,"I hope Mr. Kalevan and his family can be reunited\nsoon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_2_1,"I'm glad I was able to give you a cameo...\nIf possible, I'd like to bring him back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_3_1,"Even if I give you a cameo and a message,\nwill not be able to replace\nMr. Calevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_3_2,"Let's lend you our strength so that Kalevan can come back soon!\nMr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_4_1,"I believe\nthat I can meet some wonderful junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_5_1,"King Moonis still seems to have\nsomething in mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_5_2,"Let's listen to the story later.\nIt might be a clue to bring Mr. Calevan home."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_6_1,"I'm glad Malayka feels safe.\nIt's because we believe in each other even though we're apart."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_1_1,"I think\nyour family's worries will lessen a little if you give them Kalevan's cameo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_1_2,"Even if Kalevan can't go home,\nhis family needs to be reassured."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_2_1,"Is it a demon's lair...\nHey, there are some monsters with some bones\n, don't you think?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_3_1,"There's a monster that stole Mr. Kalevan's cameo\nIt's called a demon's lair...\nIt's got a scary name..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_4_1,"A demon's lair!\nLots of useless junk\nThat sounds like a name!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_4_2,"Come on! Let's go to\nthe devil's lair to look for junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_5_1,"You may get into a\nfight with the demon who stole your cameo.\nBe careful and go to the demon's lair."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_1,"Even with the power of Bravestone,\nI can't bring Mr. Karevan and the others back to the true world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_2,"If Mr. Crows was here at a time like this,\nhe might have told me something, but\nI don't even know where he is..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_3,"Right now, the first thing to do is to get\nKalevan's cameo back and\nmake Mareika feel at ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_1_1,"If we receive Mr. Kalevan's message,\nyour family can continue to wait with faith."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_1_2,"You promised to come back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_2_1,"...What kind of person is that sweets troll\ngoing on a date with...\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_3_1,"The Sweets Troll who stole Kalevan's cameo is a fashionable person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_3_2,"Now that you mention it, I think there is something we can learn from when it comes to fashion."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_4_1,"It's not good to assume that just because of the name\nthat there is some wonderful junk in the lair of evil spirits..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_4_2,"I learned a lot too….\nA lot of things…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_5_1,"Let's go back to King Moonis once to deliver the cameo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_1,"It was a strange monster..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_2,"Ah, instead of that, let's deliver\nthe cameo to Maleika."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_3,"I think it must be very unsettling to not know if your loved one is alive or not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_1_1,"If the true world and the false world\nNaseem's Cave are connected,\nit seems worth a try."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_1_2,"Let's go to the false world of Arahagiro to meet Seraphy and the others once again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_2_1,"It looks like Seraphi and the others can finally return to their own world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_2_2,"Now Mr. Calevan can meet\nhis family. That's good..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_3_1,"You did it! As King Moonis said,\nif Naseem's Cave is connected,\nthe Kalevans can return to their own world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_3_2,"Hurry up and let Seraphy and the others know\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_1,"I don't know if the two worlds are connected\nconvenient or inconvenient\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_2,"Well, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing\n, but...I'm glad there's a possibility of bringing Mr. Calevan back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_3,"Mukya!? Oh, stop it!\nIt's like I'm Oriko to share the same opinion as you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_4,"Eh!?\nExcuse me for that...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_5_1,"Bringing Mr. Calevan and his friends back to their home world is\na role only those of us who can freely travel between these two worlds can do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_5_2,"It's almost\nuntil Mr. Kalevan can\nlive with his family."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_6_1,"The two worlds may be connected in\nthe Cave of Naseem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_6_2,"In that case, it makes sense that Mr. Kalevan and others\nwho are residents of the true world are now in the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_1_1,"The way for Kalevan to meet his family is now open.\nNow let's go to Naseem's Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_1,"There was a sweets troll\nin that cave. Is there a secret...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_2,"I'm sure it's filled with secret junk\n!\nI'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_3,"...That's really all there is to the old man.\nWell,\nI can't say that he doesn't have any junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_3_1,"Until Mr. Calevan and Mr. Seraphy return to\ntheir own world\nI'm sure it will be soon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_4_1,"I also thought Naseem's Cave\nwas still suspicious.\nI won't go back until I find the junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_5_1,"The Seraphis have headed to\nthe Cave of Naseem. Let's hurry too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_5_2,"The place where the two worlds are connected is probably in a place\nthat is difficult to find.\nLook for it carefully."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_6_1,"If the demons who kidnapped Karevan and the others used\nNaseem's Cave to move,\nwe need to be careful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_6_2,"Be careful {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_1,"Mr. Seraphy...\nYou sent Mr. Calevan back to\nhis own world without telling him how you felt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_2,"I made this choice\nthinking about the monsters and people left behind by Mr. Karevan and the fake Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_3,"If Seraphy is in trouble,\nwe will\nhelp her instead!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_2_1,"Kalevan will be lonely, but\nSeraphi's will and determination are\nstrong..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_2_2,"Let's help\nas much as we can."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_3_1,"Mr. Seraphi had a strong will and\nwas prepared to go a different path from\nMr. Calevan."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_3_2,"Ah. You can't protect everyone half-heartedly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_1,"I had high hopes for the Hoimi slime girl, but\nshe has become so useful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_2,"It suits you to live happily while protecting Arahagiro over there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_3,"...Mr. Duston is really not honest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_5_1,"Family is a good thing.\nI'm really glad that Mr. Calevan was reunited with his family\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_1,"The Great Demon King...\nAnd the demons..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_2,"Not only did he take the life of Big Brother Toma, but he also did terrible things to\nthe people of Arahagiro Kingdom..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_3,"I don't know what you're planning, but\nI won't let you love me any more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_1_1,"Seraphi, why...\nDidn't you want to go back to\nyour original world with Mr. Calevan...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_2_1,"Why would Seraphy do something like that...\nI might never be able to see Kalevan again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_2_2,"The fact that he was going to send only Calevan back...\nThat he would remain in the false world...\nDoes that mean he had his own determination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_3_1,"Mr. Seraphy...\nI wonder why you didn't return to\nyour own world with Mr. Calevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_4_1,"Even though I couldn't read, I studied\nand was able to write a letter...\nI'm disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_4_2,"But I'm sure Mr. Calevan would be happy if he knew\n.\nHey {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_5_1,"King Munis, who was investigating the Cave of True Naseem, should have found Kalevan."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_5_2,"Let's go see King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_6_1,"The monsters closed the teleportation gate...\nThey said it was a mission from Demon Marshal Zeldrad."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_6_2,"Demon Marshal Zeldorado... Thoma's Kataki!\nAs long as I know where he is, then I'm sure...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1_flag10035,"Milt will continue to serve\nthe country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1_flag10035_out,"I'm sure there are still\npeople in Astortia waiting for our help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1,"I want to inform Father and Arold that I defeated the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2_flag10035_out,"So {pc}!\nPlease continue to take\nto all kinds of places!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2_flag10035,"I have to become even stronger so that I can\nprotect everyone even if the next enemy comes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2,"I also want to tell my father and mother\nUncle Nablett!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1_flag10035_out,"Where are you going from now on?\nMy journey with you will be training for the sword.\nI'm still planning on following you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1_flag10035,"We were able to destroy the Great Demon King's plan.\nFrom now on, I guess the days will be peaceful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1,"Finally, I was able to defeat the Great Demon King!\nHe was pretty strong, so I think my armor has also improved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1_flag10035_out,"Dear {pc}! From now on, I want to\nlearn all sorts of things as we travel\n! So... please help me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1_flag10035,"I'm glad you were able to defeat\nthe Great Demon King for everyone living in this world! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1,"To think that I, along with everyone else, defeated\nthe Great Demon King...\nI just can't believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1_flag10035_out,"Come on, former Potsucon No. 2!\nOh no, {pc}! I'm going to look for\njunk all over Astortia!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1_flag10035,"It's a good thing\nto be able to focus on collecting junk now that the Great Demon King is gone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1,"I want to be the most\nuseless man in Astortia, so I helped\nexterminate the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_2_flag10035,"Former Potsucon No. 2! Hurry\nLet's head to the next collection of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_2,"From now on, you'll be helping\nfind my junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1_flag10035_out,"As the heir to the throne of the Megistris Kingdom, I want to experience more things and learn how to protect the people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1_flag10035,"With the help of the talented Milt,\nI think the Kingdom of Grand Zedora will further develop."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1,"As the Prince of Megistris,\nI am very proud to be able to defeat the Great Demon King with you all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_2_flag10035_out,"So, Mr. {pc}\n, we look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_2_flag10035,"I also want to make the Megistris Kingdom a good country so that it can stand on par with the Kingdom of Gran Zedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1_flag10035_out,"Since you're talking about {pc},\nyou'll continue to help people in need, right?\nOf course I'll help too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1_flag10035,"{pc}...Thank you for\nfighting with me until the end."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1,"Thanks to everyone, I was able to free Big Brother Toma from\nthe spell of the Great Demon King Madesagora\nand was able to speak with him one last time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2_flag10035_out,"You don't have to worry, we have permission from your father, mother, and Lushenda.\nWe look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2_flag10035,"Regardless of whether you're my ally or not, I'm really grateful to you.\nIt's because of you that I was able to get this far."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2,"...I have to tell Milt too.\nWe witnessed the end of Big Brother Toma...\nNo. The last moments of the hero Toma."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_3_flag10035,"My mission as a hero is over, but\nI still have a big job left to do: protect this kingdom on Big Brother Toma's behalf."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_4_flag10035,"I want to borrow your power from here on out, but\nI have a feeling that an even greater\ndestiny awaits you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_5_flag10035,"But {pc} don't forget.\nJust as you were by my side,\nI'll be by your side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_1,"Melsandi Village, Celed Town\nand Arahagiro Kingdom.\nThe survey of the three areas has been completed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_2,"When I think back, the true world and the false world...\nI feel like they were very intricately intertwined."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_3,"In any case, let's report our investigation to\nLushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_2_1,"It seems that the Pendulum of Fate has enough power\n.\nI have to go back to the castle and report to Sage Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\nLet's go report the results of the investigation of the incident to Lushenda!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_4_1,"What is that, that pendulum of fate?\nA stone that has the power to help others.\nDon't let it get near me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_1_1,"As Lushenda says,\nEureka has been visiting various places."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_1_2,"Why don't you first figure out where they are and start looking for them from there?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_2_1,"The enamel old man is so\nelusive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_3_1,"Does Enamel like traveling too?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_3_2,"Perhaps you are lending your wisdom to various places as you travel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_4_1,"Sage Hollow...?\nAh! You say something incomprehensible about that railroad track of destiny..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_4_2,"I like weirdos like that, but\nI failed to see that he was an excellent person who was useful to the world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_5_1,"Is this where Mr. Hollow is?\nI remember..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_5_2,"The Landon Mountains during the decisive battle with Hades Nergel\nThe port town of Lendor that I met at the ship management office...\nIt seems like neither is the case right now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_6_1,"I have met Hollow several times as well, but...\nI don't know where she is right now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_6_2,"Do you have any idea where {pc} is?\nFor example... the place where you first met..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_1_1,"If we don't receive the results of Hollow's research,\nwe won't be able to report to Lushenda either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_1_2,"Mr. {pc}. Let's collect the purifying herbs and give them to\nHollow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_2_1,"If that ogre sage Sama is asking you to\nprepare materials for research\nsooner..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_2_2,"Mr. Enamel\nis also busy with various tasks.\nLet us collect purifying herbs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_1,"Lord Hollow, perhaps you forgot about the\nresearch that\nLushenda asked you to do...''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_2,"I can't believe you forgot such an important request\nThat's quite a prank!\nThere's so much to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_3,"...I don't think I'd be happy if I received such compliments."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_4_1,"I guess that wise old man\nis a bit of an idiot after all, isn't he?\nI'd be happier that way though!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_1,"I'm glad that the Grand Titus is now able to travel\nto the true Kingdom of Grand Zedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_2,"This will reduce the number of people who wander into the false Lendersia without knowing anything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_3,"As expected of a wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_6_1,"For a wise man, Enamel\nis a bit light-hearted, or rather\ndoesn't he seem like a goofball?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_6_2,"But I love you. The only one who calls me\nAnlucia is\nHolo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_1,"Enamel's research results were\nan elixir for preserving food."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_2,"Rangao Village is very cold, so\nwe preserve food by freezing it, but\nit's interesting to see a different preservation method."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_3,"Many parts of our lives are probably supported by\nthe power of the sage's research."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_1,"Why is that guy named Milt so aggressive towards\nAnlucia...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_2,"It's okay, Huza.\nFor Milt, I...\nYeah, it can't be helped..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_3,"...Hmm. Well, if you don't feel comfortable asking,\ndon't force yourself to ask. But don't forget that we are\nyour allies."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_4,"...Thank you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_3_1,"Enamel's research results were amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_3_2,"If you can eat cold food with the same\ntaste as freshly prepared\n, I think a lot of people will be happy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_1,"I don't like that guy named Milt\ncomplaining about the hero\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_2,"Even the old man says some stupid things sometimes.\nI don't like his attitude either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_3,"Even though I'm more useless than you,\nwhy don't you complain to me?!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_4,"...It was as usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_5_1,"That's how the wise men conduct\nresearch every day to make people's lives better."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_5_2,"...By the way, Milt's attitude.\nEven if you have strong expectations for Princess Anlucia,\nI think it's a little too harsh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_1,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_2,"Big Brother Toma...I......"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_3,"...Ah {pc}. I, the hero,\nshould have done my best, but I'm sorry.\nLet's continue investigating Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_1_1,"That Hollow\nseemed to be in more trouble than usual.\nLet's hurry and give her the purifying herbs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_2_1,"I'll quickly give the purification herb to\nEnameled Old Man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_3_1,"I wonder what kind of research the purification herbs we collected will be useful for\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_1,"Cleansing herbs.\nIf it were me, I would rather use something like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_2,"I want the herb of filth... maybe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_3,"No, if you're an old man, it's a muddy herb.\n...I don't know if such a thing really exists."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_4,"If someone reads ahead of what I want to say like that...\nIt's okay, it seems like it's useless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_5_1,"Research using purifying herbs...\nConsidering the name of the material,\nIs it a drug that can erase curses?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_5_2,"Since it was a request from the wise Lushenda,\nI have no doubt that this research will be useful to the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_6_1,"Now you can deliver the purifying herbs to\nHolo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_6_2,"Will I be able to see you again if I get on the Ark of the Earth?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_1_1,"I have to bring important research results to\nLushenda.\nBut I wonder what kind of research it is..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_2_1,"I hear about the research results of the enamel old man...\nSince it's about that old man,\nI'm worried that I might accidentally fail."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_3_1,"I wonder what kind of research\nLord Luchenda asked Holo to do...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_4_1,"That wise old man\nmay be excellent, but\nI can't hate him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_4_2,"It has an indescribable clunky smell, just like you, the former Potsucon No. 2."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_5_1,"I'm curious about Mr. Hollow's research results, but\nI can't secretly look at them, so\nI'll deliver them to Mr. Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_6_1,"I was a little worried because it seems that Mr. Hollow is always being asked by Ms. Luchenda to do difficult research\n, but I'm relieved now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_6_2,"The only thing left to do is hand over the results of Hollow's research to\nLushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_1_1,"Queen...\nYou seem to be in trouble because you haven't finished your cloak.\nLet us help you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_2_1,"This is the cloak that the queen ordered...\nI'm curious to see what the completed cloak will look like."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_2_2,"Let's go talk to the armor shop."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_3_1,"Sir {pc}! The Queen seems to be\nin trouble, so\nlet us help her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_1,"Former Potsukon No. 2 is always asking for favors.\nIf you become useless like me,\nno one will ask for favors."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_2,"Ah, Mr. Duston, I think you can be reliable as a traveling companion."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_3,"Hey! Yu Yu Yu The hero princess\nhas praised me! What a shame!\nFormer Potsukon No. 2! Please taunt me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_4,"Ah... oh, I guess I said something\nwrong...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_5_1,"I would like to respond\nto Princess Julia's feelings for Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_6_1,"I understand that your mother is worried, but\neveryone is with me, so\nI'm not worried about anything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_6_2,"{pc}\nThank you for your continued support."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_1_1,"In order not to keep the queen waiting,\nlet's hurry and defeat the monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_2_1,"If it's difficult to obtain the materials,\nmeans you'll be dealing with tough monsters.\n...Heh, it's ringing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_3_1,"Just hearing the name, Moonlight Golden Thread,\nyou can tell how beautiful it is.\nI want to see it soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_4_1,"Is it a watchtower?\nI don't know what it's guarding, but if you climb to the top\nit looks like it'll be easier to find junk in the distance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_4_2,"Instead of climbing the watchtower,\nwe are going to defeat the monsters near it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_5_1,"An embroidered cloak made of precious thread...\nI'm sure it's a gift for someone special."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_6_1,"The watchtower is located\nsouth of the Grand Zedora Kingdom.\nLook for the monster you want near there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_1_1,"I hope it doesn't put any more stress on the Queen's body and mind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_1_2,"Mr. {pc}, let us\ndo what we have to do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_2_1,"...I'll keep quiet about what I saw in the royal tombs.\nI'll keep my promise to the queen.\nFind Prince Thoma's body right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_3_1,"I hope the prince's body is found soon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_3_2,"Dear {pc}.\nIf there's anything we can do to help, let's do something!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_4_1,"When a grave is vandalized, it starts to glow\nIsn't this pendulum of fate\na piece of crap?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_4_2,"It may be that the theft of Prince Thoma's body has a lot to do with\nour fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_5_1,"Princess Julia must be suffering\nso as not to make the people around her uneasy\nI see you are enduring it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_6_1,"...As your mother said,\nIf you make too much noise,\nyou won't be able to find anything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_6_2,"Leave the search for Big Brother Toma's body to Captain Nogato.\nWe will report to Luchenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_1_1,"Golden Moonlight Thread... It's so pretty!\nDefinitely a worthy ingredient for the\nmantle the Queen ordered."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_1_2,"Let's deliver it to the armor shop ASAP to\ncomplete the mantle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_2_1,"I've gathered the amount of moonlight gold thread you requested.\nIf you have this much, you won't have any trouble making a cloak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_2_2,"Hurry up, let's go to the armor shop."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_3_1,"The thread is so pretty... This should\nmake for an elegant mantle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_4_1,"I have no interest in glittering threads, so please deliver them to me quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_5_1,"I hope the Queen will be happy with the cloak\nmade using this beautiful thread."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_6_1,"Let's deliver the rest of the Golden\nMoonlight Thread we collected to the armor\nshop owner, Renken."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_1_1,"I'm sure the Queen is looking forward to\nthe completion of the cloak. Let's go back to the castle and\ntell the Queen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_2_1,"I'm sure the queen will be happy when the cloak is completed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_3_1,"I hope the cloak is completed soon and\nI can see the happy face of the queen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_4_1,"I'd like junk as a thank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_4_2,"Huh?...I wonder if there was any junk in Gran Zedora Castle that\nMr. Duston would be happy with?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_5_1,"The only thing left to do is to report to Princess Julia.\nI think Princess Julia's private room was on the third floor of Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_6_1,"Your mother's request has been completed.\nI hope this will put your mother's mind at least a little\nat ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_1,"Prince Thoma was a fine man who was determined to protect his sister."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_2,"Inheriting that determination,\nwe will continue to protect Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_3,"Thank you, Maille.\nI'm counting on you.\nBut...please let me protect everyone too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_2_1,"Prince Thoma has been fighting\ndesperately for Anlucia for a long time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_2_2,"Yes. That's why I will become a great hero and live up to my brother's name."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_3_1,"Queen...I wonder how you felt when Prince Thomas told you\nthat he would be taking Anlucia's place..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_3_2,"Either way,\nour beloved child is in danger...\nThat feeling is indescribable to us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_4_1,"I have no interest in the royal tombs!\nThere are only precious things!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_5_1,"The cloak you requested was\nan offering to the deceased Prince Thoma..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_1,"Hey, {pc}, I have a request too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_2,"My Mother is going to offer the mantle in\nthe Royal Family's Tomb at Reviewle Highway\nNorth. I'd like us to go there together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_3,"Big Brother Toma used to say, he was proud\nto protect me himself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_4,"So, for Big Brother Toma's sake, I will\nbecome a hero worthy of the legendary\ntitle.\n<br>\nThat is what I would like to tell him, in\nfront of his grave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_1_1,"Who stole Prince Toma's body...! The Queen\nand Anlucia shouldn't have to mourn over\nand over...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_2_1,"...The Queen totally collapsed. Before\nanything else, we ought to head back to\nthe castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_3_1,"Why would Prince's body be missing,\nI wonder..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_3_2,"...Um, whatever the reason, we have to look\nfor the prince's body!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_4_1,"Ta steal a dead body, ya just can't help\nsome guys! Even I wouldn't do somethin\nlike dat!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_5_1,"I have heard about royal tombs being prime\ntargets for grave robbers.\n<br>\nBy no means did I expect something like\nthe theft of Prince Toma's body..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_5_2,"Queen Julia and Princess Anlucia are\nalready grieving, this act is too much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_6_1,"To steal Big Brother Toma's body...\nWhy would someone do such a heartless\nthing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_6_2,"...I'm alright, apart from worrying about\nmy mother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_5_1,"It seems that the pendulum of fate has gained power after investigating the abnormalities in the three regions."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_5_2,"I was able to change Melsandi Cered Arahagiro's\nfate...\nDoes that mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_6_1,"Of course I remember registering my room in Lulastone, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_6_2,"I'm sure I'll have to go back\nto Gran Zedora Castle many times from now on to report to Lushenda, so please help me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_1_1,"In the false world where the pendulum pointed\nLet's go get water, grass, and stones."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_1,"The sage Sama's errands are water, grass, and stones.\nIt's a pain, but I have no choice but to do it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_2,"What is the\ninvestigation that Lushenda will conduct?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_3,"Come on. Sage Sama has a deep plan that we would never imagine.\nEven if we thought about it, we wouldn't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_3_1,"I wonder what kind of investigation Luchenda will do with water, grass, and stones\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_3_2,"I'm sure this is amazing research that I can't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_4_1,"Water, grass, stones...\nAre you jealous of my collection of junk?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_4_2,"I don't think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_5_1,"We don't need anything special to investigate, but\ncollecting them is something only those of us who have Brave Stones can do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_6_1,"The places where you can find things are\nthe Waldo water source in the false world, the Rhône Forest belt\n, and the Defel Wilderness."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_6_2,"It doesn't seem necessary to fight monsters, so let's collect them quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_1_1,"I worked hard to collect them, but...\nWhat does this have to do with ordinary water, grass, and stones causing something strange?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_1_2,"No matter how you look at it,\nit doesn't seem like anything special..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_2_1,"...water, stones, and grass.\n...Sage Sama's errands\nwere surprisingly easy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_2_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle and give what we gathered to\nSage Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_3_1,"Water, grass, and stones... you've gathered them all!\nTo give them to Lushenda\nLet's go back to Gran Zedora's castle!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_4_1,"I found a lot of things too!\nWhat do you think about this weird smelling water!\nDirty colored grass! Stones that are hard to hold!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_4_2,"…What?\nI won't give it to you if you make that face!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_5_1,"As expected of the Sage of the Crown of Wisdom, you can understand\nwhat is about to happen in this world with something as trivial as this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_6_1,"Water from the Waldo source of the false world\nGrass from the Rhone forest belt\nAnd stone from the Defel wilderness..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_6_2,"Now we have\neverything we need for the investigation.\nLet's go back to reporting to Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_1_1,"I can't let the Great Demon King Madesagora go wild like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_1_2,"Mr. {pc}!\nLet's definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_2_1,"If we don't defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora\nbefore the world is taken away, those in this world will be exposed to\ndanger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_2_2,"...We have to protect this world with our hands."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_3_1,"I don't want this world we live in to be taken away by the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_3_2,"We absolutely must stop the Great Demon King's plan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_4_1,"Is the Great Demon King trying to turn this entire world into\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_4_2,"If something like that were to happen,\nall the junk I've collected would be worth the same as\nanything else!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_5_1,"Painting out the true world with a false world...\nI never thought they would do what they tried to do in the town of Celed on\nall of the Lendersia continent."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_5_2,"No, on the contrary, it may be a plan to wipe out all of Astortia\n.\nWe must stop it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_1,"As expected, the Great Demon King Madesagora\nwas trying to invade our world with his false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_2,"If that happens,\nthis world may be remade as the Great Demon King pleases."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_3,"It's not just a problem in this world.\nEven people living in a fake world\ndon't know what will happen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_4,"Raska, Mayor Gash...\nI want to protect those people too.\nTo do that, I need your help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_5,"Also, I'm curious about the presence of the masked man.\nHe must be plotting something with the Hero's Ring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_1_1,"I'm worried that the soldier I sent to pick up the medicine hasn't\nreturned."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_1_2,"If the soldier seems to be in trouble,\nlet's help him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_2_1,"It's probably some medicine kept in the treasure room...\nIt must be something valuable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_2_2,"I'm worried about the soldiers, so let's go to the royal treasury."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_3_1,"Without medicine,\nLushenda can't do her research, and\nI'm also worried about the soldiers who haven't returned."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_4_1,"Is it the royal treasure house...? Even in places like that where it seems like there are only\nvaluable things, I'll find\njunk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_4_2,"I think Ms. Luchenda has sorted out the treasure room\nand disposed of unnecessary items...\nI think it would be better not to tell Mr. Duston."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_1,"Speaking of Sea Breeze Cave, it has the same name as the place where there was a secret passageway to Gran Zedora Castle in the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_2,"Mr. Crows suddenly appeared at that time, but I wonder where he is and what he's doing these days."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_3,"Come to think of it, I still didn't understand why you helped us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_6_1,"Let's go\nto the royal treasury in Sea Breeze Cave. I'm worried about the soldiers who went to get medicine and haven't returned."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_6_2,"I hope nothing happens..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_1_1,"...How could Milt say something so\ncoldhearted to Anlucia, I wonder. As a\nfriend, I feel terrible for her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_2_1,"Anlucia would never ditch {pc}\nand us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_2_2,"What does that Milt jerk see in Anlucia\nthat's so bad, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_3_1,"The Great Demon King's plan is something we\nmust stop at all costs. Isn't that right,\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_4_1,"Monsters who steal useless rings, ya ain't\nhavta worry about 'em! I'll protect my\njunk no matter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_5_1,"The Great Demon King stealing away the\nprevious hero's ring. What sort of plan\ncould he have for it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_5_2,"As Sage Lushenda says, the demons should\nnot benefit from possessing the ring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_6_1,"......."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_6_2,"{pc}... I want you to believe me.\nI will never run away like that again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_1_1,"Aroldo...Aro...\nHehe. It doesn't really suit you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_1,"That woman named Sinon and Ryu are quite into."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_2,"I don't care what you like, but\ntrying to make him sing using something as outrageous as a jig file is... that's not funny."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_3,"I can\ntell you that I like Ryu, but...\nIt's not good to be too harsh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_3_1,"I'm scared that you're going to force me to sing\nwith a file in my neck\nMr. Sinon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_4_1,"That client, Sinon, is like me and can't do anything other than what she likes.\nShe smells like a piece of shit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_4_2,"I'm looking forward to seeing how you use the jigoku file when you get it\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_5_1,"I'm asking you to obtain a Jigoku file.\nIs it really a good idea to accept\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_5_2,"No... No,\n{pc} made the decision.\nI'm sure it'll be fine, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_6_1,"Looks like you can get the Jigoku file\non Coniware Plains."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_6_2,"...But how do you make someone sing with a file?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_1_1,"A jigoku file...\nNeither the name nor the appearance\nlooks like a tool that can make humans sing, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_1_2,"Anyway, let's give it to Sinon.\nAnd if anything happens, we can help Ryu."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_2_1,"I got a file for Jigoku, but...\nIs Ryu okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_3_1,"I got the Jigoku file, but I wonder if\nI really can give it to Mr. Sinon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_3_2,"Since you asked for it,\nI have no choice but to give it to you...\nI'm a little worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_4_1,"I'm looking forward to seeing what that client will do with the\nfile!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_5_1,"Ugh...I wonder how you can make people sing with such a jagged file."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_6_1,"I don't know much about it, but\nI wonder if there's a song about using a file?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_1_1,"Driftwood Ryu...\nIndeed, as a name,\ndoesn't seem out of place."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_1_2,"But it also sounds like someone's name, so\nI get it wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_2_1,"Driftwood Ryu...\nDo you understand that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_2_2,"Anyway, I was relieved that it wasn't a person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_3_1,"I'm glad Ryu was made of driftwood..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_4_1,"Guppupu!\nThe client was quite the weirdo!\nI can't lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_4_2,"I don't think I've lost enough even as it is now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_5_1,"It's important to convey correct information...\nI also have to be careful not to be misunderstood by people..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_1,"I'm an instrument craftsman who loves musical instruments...\nI don't think I'll be able to imitate him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_2,"I learned to play musical instruments when I was little.\nMy mother told me that this was also the behavior of a princess of the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_3,"But it seems like I don't have the talent.\nNo matter how much I practice, I just can't play well.\nIt seems like I've gotten complaints from somewhere..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_4,"Ever since then, I don't like playing instruments.\nI love listening to them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_5,"Ah. Sorry.\nI keep talking about myself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_1_1,"Dr. Rossum's research will not progress if the tablet remains stolen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_1_2,"Defeat Stoneman in Solaria Canyon and retrieve the\nSlate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_1,"I can't imagine that a monster would want a stone tablet...\nEven if the characters are difficult for humans to decipher,\nCan a monster read it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_2,"I can't deny that possibility.\nThere are probably monsters in this world who are more intelligent than us and have deeper knowledge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_3,"Intelligence and knowledge….\nFor some reason, it reminded me of the Garden of Learning."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_3_1,"The mystery of the lithograph...I'm really interested in it too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_3_2,"Dear {pc}, let's defeat Stoneman and return the\nSlate to the Doctor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_4_1,"You're a monster with no sense\nfor stealing a stone tablet that is useful for research!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_4_2,"Is it a matter of taste...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_5_1,"Ancient history and culture are also precious treasures.\nLet's recover the stolen tablets."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_6_1,"I wonder what Stoneman is going to do with\ntaking the tablets?\nI hope he doesn't eat them..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_1_1,"We successfully retrieved the tablet.\nNow, let's go deliver it to Dr. Rossum."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_2_1,"It's a really old stone tablet.\nI have no idea what it says on it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_2_2,"I have no idea what it's worth, but...\nWell, it's important to that doctor.\nLet's deliver it to him quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_3_1,"Let's give the tablet back to the doctor.\nWhat is written on this tablet?\nI want Dr. Rossum to tell me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_4_1,"I'm not interested in precious stone tablets!\nI'll collect\nthe stones around there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_4_2,"Yes, yes, Mr. Duston.\nI'll collect the stones later,\nand I'll go give the tablet to Dr. Rossum."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_5_1,"This stone tablet is filled with\npast history and culture.\nWe have to cherish it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_6_1,"I'm glad you got the stone tablet back safely.\n...It hasn't been chewed on, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_1,"What if… if our travels were written on stone tablets and remained until the distant future, I wonder if someone would read them and study them…"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_2,"It's a very romantic story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_3,"When I think about that, I get kind of nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_2_1,"All of Astortia is shaking\nGod's mystery..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_2_2,"It's so grand that I can't get enough of it.\nMy goal is to defeat the enemy in front of me,\nand protect the person I want to protect. I hope I can do that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_3_1,"I can't believe that the human god's\ngreat secret was written on that stone tablet...!\nI'm glad we were able to get it back from the monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_3_2,"You said that you would\ntell me a new story once the deciphering progresses.\nI'm looking forward to it, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_4_1,"Aww!!\nI'm so chilled that I helped you make such a valuable discovery!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_5_1,"Because of scholars like Dr. Rossum,\nwe can carve a new future\nbased on history."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_1,"...I see.The object of worship that was found in the ruins of\nOld God in Solaria Canyon was\nGran Zenis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_2,"By the way, there is also a book written about the god Gran Zenis in the library of Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_3,"According to that, the god Gran Zenis bestowed\nthe power of destroying demons and saving the world\non selected humans."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_4,"That's right... That's the beginning of being a hero.\nI don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the god Gran Zenis is the\norigin of the Kingdom of Gran Zedora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_5,"Yeah. It was a good opportunity for me to once again remember my mission as a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_1_1,"If Gran Zedora's soldiers were to go around\nasking around in the Arahagiro Kingdom,\nit would certainly become a big deal..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_1_2,"Let's cooperate with the investigation in Arahagiro Kingdom so that Prince Thoma's body can be found as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_2_1,"We can't publicly say\nthat the prince's body is missing...\nWe should take action."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_3_1,"We have to\nsecretly search for the prince's body so as not to worry other countries."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_1,"Stealing valuable things and selling them off are boring people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_2,"Huh... Even old men sometimes say\ntrivial things.\nI agree. Stealing is boring, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_3,"Absolutely.\nIf you want to steal my precious junk like Chiri, I understand!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_4,"...Ah, that's right.\nI guess you're a little off.\nThis old man..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_5_1,"Did the culprit go to Arahagiro Kingdom to sell\nthe stolen goods after opening up Prince Thoma's grave?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_5_2,"First of all, I think it would be a good idea to go to Arahagiro Castle and talk to a person named Darash who is in charge of\ncrime control."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_6_1,"{pc}. Thank you for accepting the\nrequest from Captain Nogato."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_6_2,"Please lend me your power so that Big Brother Toma can rest in peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_1_1,"Mr. Darash and the others can't catch\ngrave robbers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_1_2,"It's like stealing from the royal tombs.\nI'm sure they're all good at it.\nDon't let your guard down..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_2_1,"Desert Earth Dragon... That's a pretty good name.\nHe's going out of his way to steal treasure from the royal tombs.\nHe must be some bastard."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_1,"They're a group of grave robbers who are quick on the run and are inciting monsters...\nThey seem formidable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_2,"But it's for the Queen and Anlucia.\nYou can't say something weak!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_3,"Thank you, Fuura."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_4_1,"Desert Earth Dragon...\nI don't know if it's strong or weak\nIt smells like a lump!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_5_1,"It's\ntroubling that they won't cooperate with us in catching the grave robbers, but\nit might actually be convenient for us to proceed with the investigation in secret."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_6_1,"The Desert Earth Dragon...\nThat's the group of grave robbers that stole Big Brother Toma's body."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_6_2,"I'll definitely catch it...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_1_1,"I hope this investigation will make some progress..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_1_2,"If we don't find Prince Thoma's body soon,\nPrincess Anlucia and the Queen will continue to suffer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_2_1,"Did the grave robbers tell the truth?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_2_2,"What is the culprit going to do after stealing the prince's body\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_3_1,"I'm glad that the culprit who stole the prince's burial goods was found, but...\nThe body was never found..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_4_1,"Even I have no idea what\nthe guy who steals a dead body feels."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_5_1,"Aside from the ornaments, why did the real culprit steal\nPrince Thoma's body\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_1,"If you leave the matter about the grave robbers to Captain Nogato, you'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_2,"It's me.\nThat person once helped me when I went to subjugate a monster.\nThat time, I seriously injured him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_3,"But he laughed it off and comforted me, saying\nMy medal has increased by one more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_4,"I may look like a scary person, but\nI'm actually a very kind person.\nI think that's why I was chosen to be a soldier commander."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_1,"If we're to believe what the bandits said\nearlier, Prince Toma's body may have been\nstolen by someone else somehow..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_2,"But the royal tomb is supposed to be\ninaccessible, except to members of the\nroyal family..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_3,"Hmm... Anyways, reporting this to Captain\nNogato sounds good, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_1,"That Darash guy had some awfully good\ntiming to show up when he did..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_2,"He didn't plan for us to catch those\nDesert Mole guys, instead of doing it\nthemselves, did he...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_3,"What do you think... Guess we'll never know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_3_1,"To break into a grave and do something like\nsteal what's in the coffin, it's disgusting!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_4_1,"I knew they were a bunch of useless thieves.\nI kind of like them!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_1,"Mr. Darash seemed to be concerned about us\nand came running to see us, didn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_2,"When we spoke to him in Al-Ahagiro Kingdom,\nI honestly had the impression that he was\nnot a serious person...\n<br>\nPerhaps, he is a better person than I had\nthought."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_3,"I suppose, working for King Moonis, he\nwould have to be a good man. I must learn\nto be a better judge of character."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_6_1,"By the time the Desert Moles showed up,\nsomeone had already stolen Big Brother\nToma's body...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_6_2,"Somehow, I think it will be difficult to\nget any more information here. Let's go\nback and report to Captain Nogato."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_1_1,"If you have a bad back, it can't be helped that you can't go to a hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_1_2,"Let's take\nYunohana to the old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_2_1,"Yakupu, the old man\nmust have really liked hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_2_2,"It's\nhard not being able to freely go anywhere you like... Let's quickly pick up some branches and shells and\nbring Yunohana from the hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_3_1,"When I heard Mr. Yakup's story\n... it seems like it was a pretty open hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_4_1,"I'll leave it to you\nto look for treasure shells and other beautiful things, and I'll\nlook for junk like usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_5_1,"I don't think there was a place called Montserro Hot Springs Gorge in the fake world, but...\nIs there a reason?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_5_2,"Come on.\nI guess the Great Demon King hates Flo?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_6_1,"It seems that the hot springs are good for healing injuries, but\nI don't think I can go because my back hurts.\nI feel bad for Yakup as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_1_1,"I'd like to exchange white plum branches and pale pink treasure shells for yunohana...\nMaybe it's a bit romantic."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_2_1,"I got the branches and shells.\nLet's go to the hot spring manager!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_3_1,"It's a pity that Mr. Yakupu himself couldn't bring the white plum branch and\npale red treasure shell to exchange\nwith Yunohana..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_4_1,"...It's a hot spring.\nEven if it's not as strong as the ocean, it's unsettling to be surrounded by a large amount of\nwater."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_5_1,"In exchange for Yunohana, you received a branch of white plum blossoms and a pale red jewel shell\n.I guess the hot spring manager likes beautiful things..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_6_1,"It's kind of wonderful to bring\nbeautiful shells and scented branches from the seaside as souvenirs to the hot spring gorge in the mountains."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_1,"Hehe. After all, the two of you\nhave been thinking about each other for a long time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_2,"Don't talk about gals\nWouldn't it be better to stab the old man with a nail?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_3,"If I was thinking about Luzina that much,\nI don't think I would talk about other girls..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_2_1,"Yakub's old man, I hope you can heal your back quickly and meet\nLuzina's grandmother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_3_1,"If you like Luzina, wouldn't it be better to talk about sexy gals in moderation?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_4_1,"It's scary how Yunohana can make a weak old person healthy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_4_2,"I don't think so…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_5_1,"Yakub will also be able to\nreunite with Luzina someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_5_2,"I hope you two stay healthy for longer than the time we spent thinking about each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_6_1,"I'm glad Yakup is doing well.\nNo matter how old you are, your feelings for others are important."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_1_1,"I want to go to the hot springs, but\nMr. Yakupu is waiting for me.\nLet's deliver Yunohana right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_2_1,"A hot spring, huh?\nYou should go to the hot springs to relieve the fatigue of your journey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_2_2,"It looks really comfortable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_3_1,"It's nice...hot springs.\nI want to soak in it, even if it's just for my feet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_4_1,"It's called Yunohana, so\nI was wondering what kind of flower it was, but\nIsn't it a powder with a strange smell?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_4_2,"I kinda liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_5_1,"I'm glad that there doesn't seem to be any\nabnormality happening at Montserro Hot Springs Gorge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_6_1,"Once you've finished everything you need to do,\nit would be nice to relax in a hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_6_2,"When I go to the hot springs, I want to invite my father and\nmother as well.\nOf course, {pc} too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_1_1,"I feel a little uncomfortable\ninvestigating other people's backgrounds..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_1_2,"{pc}, let's listen to the story quickly and\nwithout attracting too much attention."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_1,"I'm sure there are\nthings in the past that you don't want anyone to know about..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_2,"Hey {pc}!\nI have a request to investigate a guy named Zodera...\nIf you accept it, I'll help you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_3,"I don't really care about it.\n...and that priest named Juaro\ndoesn't really bother me either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_3_1,"I understand Juaro's point, but\nI think it's not a good idea to secretly investigate the other party."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_3_2,"I feel confused somehow..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_1,"That priest named Juaro\nLooks like a fool and I hate him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_2,"This time, I agree with the old man.\nI don't want a guy who looks like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_3,"Hmm? Huza... It seems that you have finally awakened to\nyour path as my comrade! You are most welcome!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_4,"No, I don't know about the Ponkotsu road!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_1,"I understand why the person who becomes the high priest of the Dharma Temple should be\nclean and innocent, but\nI don't feel very good about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_2,"But what kind of person is Mr. Zodera?\nI don't think listening to the stories of everyone at the Dharma Temple is a bad thing in itself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_3,"Even if a bad rumor comes out...\nIt is an important responsibility of those in higher positions\nto know about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_6_1,"Mr. Juaro spoke in a bit of a prickly way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_6_2,"If there are no problems after questioning,\nI'm sure you'll agree."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_1_1,"It's a bit unnatural for a priest who is passionate about his training to go to a bar...\nIt might just be a chance to take a breather, but\nIt's a bit unnatural to be with someone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_2_1,"Did you get to hear the story?\n...Priests called Zodera don't seem to want to get involved with other people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_3_1,"I heard a lot of stories from everyone at the temple.\n...Mr. Zodera is very strict.\nIt feels a little scary."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_4_1,"Is that priest named Zodera a drinker with whom you have a bad relationship?\nI think it's good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_5_1,"Based on what I heard\n, I can't say anything yet..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_6_1,"The results of the investigation are not clear.\nIn any case, let's tell Mr. Juaro\nwhat we heard."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_1_1,"Juaro doesn't seem to agree, but\nI think it's better to leave it to the High Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_2_1,"If Zodera was a bad person,\nGrand Priest Sama wouldn't be on our side..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_2_2,"Mr. Zodera is a scary person, but\nhe's probably not a bad person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_3_1,"The High Priest may know Mr. Juaro and\nMr. Zodera that we don't know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_3_2,"I guess that's why I trust Zodera."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_4_1,"By the way, there was a traveling entertainer troupe in the courtyard.\nThey might have some nice junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_5_1,"Juaro seems to be remorseful as well, so\nI guess he was really worried about the future of the Dharma Temple and asked us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_6_1,"Hey {pc}. Would you like to talk to\nthe dancer of the traveling entertainer troupe in the temple courtyard?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_6_2,"My friend Janna was also\na dancer in a traveling entertainer troupe, so I was interested in her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_1_1,"...It's not good for you to secretly investigate people behind their backs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_1_2,"But\nit's not good for you to throw away something you've already accepted.\nLet's go to the bar in Ceredo!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_2_1,"...I don't really feel like it, but\nI've already accepted all the requests.\nSince I've been asked to do it, I have no choice but to do it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_3_1,"Now I have to\nfollow Mr. Zodera..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_3_2,"Background checks can be daunting."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_4_1,"Sounds interesting!\nLet's go to the bar in Ceredo and find out if a priest called Zodera is a weirdo or not!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_5_1,"Ugh. You're the kind of person who searches for people like this...\nBut when you turn down a request once you've accepted it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_6_1,"...I guess that's what's going to happen.\nI'm also concerned that things remain unclear.\nIf this happens, let's keep in touch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_1_1,"Mr. Zodera...\nsaid something quite disturbing at the bar, but\nI couldn't catch the important part."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_1_2,"Let's go report to Mr. Juaro what we heard earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_1,"...Didn't that guy Zodera say something pretty\nweird?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_2,"I couldn't hear who he was talking about, but\nhe said, I was the one who killed him''..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_3,"I don't want to believe it, but\nI think it might happen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_3_1,"What Zodera was saying\nI couldn't hear it very well, but\nyou were talking dangerously..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_4_1,"I like weirdos, but\nI'm not interested in murdering people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_5_1,"It wasn't like he was joking, and\nI don't think it's very easy to kill him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_6_1,"That person named Zodera\nI feel like I've seen her somewhere...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_1_1,"If you have a history of giving up on\npeople who might become the next high priest,\nthat's a big problem..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_1_2,"I think I understand\nMr. Juaro's feelings of hurry."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_2_1,"A witness...\nI wonder if the High Priest Sama will believe what we saw?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_3_1,"Zodera...\nI wonder if you really gave up on people in the past..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_4_1,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\nI have no interest in killing people, so please finish this request quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_5_1,"The story has turned into a big deal.\nBut if it's true that you abandoned someone,\nwe can't just ignore it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_6_1,"…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_6_2,"Ah. Sorry {pc}.\nI was just thinking.\nShall we go to the High Priest?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_1_1,"In the first place, our story alone is not enough to convince the\nHigh Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_1_2,"I just overheard\nZodera talking about something disturbing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_2_1,"I understand Juaro's point, but\nGrand Priest Sama is too supportive of Zodera.\n...Is it just my imagination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_3_1,"Isn't it better to believe in the words of the High Priest and not pursue Mr. Zodera too deeply?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_4_1,"Come on! Let's accept\nthanks from a priest named Juaro and move on!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_4_2,"I'd be happy if I could get some junk, but\nI can't expect much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_5_1,"The high priest probably has something in mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_6_1,"That's what the high priest said\nI'm sure it'll be fine.\nI also feel like I can trust Zodera."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_1_1,"If you make a wish on a bud and when the flower blooms,\nyour dream will come true. How romantic!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_2_1,"In order for Reedy's wish to come true,\nlet's take her to the Hill of Hope in the Rhône Forest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_3_1,"Make a wish on the bud of the flower of hope….\nCan I try it too, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_4_1,"You can get all the junk in the world just by making a wish on a flower!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_4_2,"If it's all a lie that dreams come true\nWell then, that's a lot of crap!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_5_1,"A flower that makes dreams come true...\nWhat a wonderful story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_6_1,"...{pc}.\nLet's go to\nthe hill where the flower of hope blooms in the Rhone forest belt."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_6_2,"So that Mr. Lidi can make a wish to\nthe Flower of Hope..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_1_1,"Even though Mr. Reedy is motivated,\nI don't have to say anything to push him away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_1_2,"I guess Mr. Zodera doesn't want to interact with anyone\nafter all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_2_1,"Reedy guy...\nEven if Zodera says something unpleasant\nI hope you don't get discouraged and do your best."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_3_1,"I can't forgive you for saying something negative to Mr. Lidi who is trying his best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_4_1,"That dancer named Lidi\nis incredibly positive, isn't she?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_4_2,"Even if you're not good at it at first,\nyou'll work hard and get better at it, so\njust look at it, it's not my thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_5_1,"Is it because Mr. Zodera was cold towards Mr. Lidi because he thought you were immature?\nI don't think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_1,"Lidi admired Janna and became\na dancer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_2,"Janna was a dancer who was so thrilling to watch\nand did such wonderful dances, but\nshe's already passed away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_3,"But I also didn't know that the Shitar troupe that Janna was in became\nthe Gizanto troupe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_1_1,"After losing Janna, I wonder if\nI have lost sight of the meaning of my job as chairperson."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_2_1,"That stubby-looking man\nwas originally the chairman of a traveling entertainer troupe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_2_2,"The fact that you didn't respond to\nthe old man from Gizant's persuasion means that Janna feels responsible for\nthe dancer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_3_1,"I wonder if Zodera is devoting herself to her training because she feels guilty for\nlosing Janna..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_3_2,"If that's the case, perhaps Zodera has too much sense of responsibility..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_4_1,"Not only do you want to drink it, but you're a serious priest!\nI'm totally disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_4_2,"I want you to emulate my potsucon a little!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_5_1,"The reason I heard you say killed'' at the bar before was because\nMr. Zodera felt that much responsible for\nMr. Janna's death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_5_2,"Is this what the High Priest said there was nothing to worry about?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_6_1,"Mr. Zodera is the chairman of the Shital troupe...\nI felt like I had seen him somewhere before, but I guess that's what happened after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_6_2,"...I can't believe he felt so responsible for Janna's death that he quit the\ntroupe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_1_1,"The fact that the High Priest is asking us for\ncooperation may be\na big problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_1_2,"Let's hear from Mr. Gizanto."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_2_1,"Hey, hey...\nAre you in trouble before the appointment ceremony...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_3_1,"What is the troupe's problem...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_3_2,"{pc}, if we can do anything\n, let's help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_4_1,"So, you just agreed to help someone?\nAs a thank you, this time I'll get\nsome junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_5_1,"In the basement of the Dharma Temple,\noffer prayers for peace in this world...\nThe high priest had such a role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_5_2,"Is it like Azran's wind ceremony?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_6_1,"{pc}.\nI will also ask you to do so.\nLet's solve the problem of the Gizanto troupe together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_1_1,"If the costumes don't arrive,\nReedy won't be able to dance!\nLet's hurry to the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_2_1,"Wow, it's such a fuss that the costumes haven't arrived yet.\nWell, let's go find them quickly.\nIt's a village between Ceredo and Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_1,"I totally understand why Reedi is so particular about costumes.Because with costumes, you can bear everyone's expectations and feelings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_2,"When I wore the Kaze no Koromo at the Kazeokuri no Ceremony,\nI felt that everyone\ngave me power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_3,"Dear {pc}. Let's go find\nan outfit for Reedy so she can\ndance for everyone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_4_1,"There's no junk in Dharma Temple, so\nI'd be happy to accompany you\non your way to Arahagiro, looking for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_5_1,"Mr. Reedy was\nenthusiastic about making Mr. Zodera have fun...\nI want to make sure he is fully prepared so that he can dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_6_1,"Dancers' costumes are like weapons for us, so it can't be helped that Mr. Reedi is concerned about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_6_2,"Speaking of a village between Arahagiro and\nDharma Temple...\nIs it near the waterfall in the Llana Desolation Area?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_1,"Reedy's dance\nmoved the hearts of others\nIt was amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_2,"Yes, I think dancers and traveling entertainers are\namazing. Their performances can brighten people's hearts\nand energize them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_3,"I also respect people like them who use their honed skills to cheer up your soul.\n...Uncle Nablett, I hope you're doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_2_1,"The old man from Zodera... no, Chairman Shital.\nThe way he encouraged Reedy during the entertainment\nHe certainly looked like the chairman of a troupe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_2_2,"I ended up going back to the troupe instead of the High Priest Sama, but...I think it was a good thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_3_1,"If Mr. Shital returns to the chair,\nMr. Lidi will become a great dancer\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_3_2,"Ah, that's right.\nI'm sure you'll build a good teacher-pupil relationship."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_1,"The Dharma Temple is not my cup of tea after all, with no junk or junk.\nPlease call me when it becomes a ruin."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_2,"I wonder if Mr. Duston\nwill be alive by then...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_3,"Well, even Mr. Duston\nwouldn't it be difficult...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_4,"No... I'm talking about an old man, so\nI don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_5,"Uh, {pc}...\nMr. Duston, isn't everyone treating you strangely...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_1,"It was all prepared by the high priest...\nAs expected of someone who protects the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_2,"Raguas will become a worthy\nking, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_3,"Of course.\nTo that end, I have to learn more\non this journey!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_1,"Janna's death was not\nShital's fault.\nI'm glad you returned to the chair."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_2,"I'm sure Lidi will bring smiles to the faces of\nas many people as Janna."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_3,"When we defeat the Great Demon King and peace is achieved,\nI would like to ask him to perform at Gran Zedora Castle again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_1_1,"I can't believe you stole my precious costume!\nLet's quickly get it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_2_1,"I didn't know that the delivery man was attacked by monsters.\nIf that's the case, then we should have come.\nIt was the right thing to do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_2_2,"{pc}!\nHurry up and get\nReedy's outfit back from Star Lemming!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_3_1,"We will absolutely get back\nReedy's precious costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_4_1,"Stealing a dancer's costume\nYou're a monster that stinks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_5_1,"If we hadn't come,\nwe almost wouldn't have received the costume.\nNow, let's find the monster that stole the costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_6_1,"The one who stole the costume was Star Lemming!\nIf you hurry, he should still have it with him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_1_1,"I have to hurry and deliver the precious costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_2_1,"You managed to get the dancer's costume back.\nOkay, let's get the costume quickly.\nReedy and the others are waiting!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_3_1,"If we don't quickly deliver the costume to Mr. Reedy,\nMr. Reedy's turn will begin!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_4_1,"It's not that easy to find nice junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_4_2,"Hmm? Did you find what you were looking for\n?\nIf you want to deliver it, I'll go right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_5_1,"I'm glad your costume hasn't been bitten.\nLet's go back to the Dharma Temple before Mr. Lidi's turn comes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_6_1,"I'm glad you got your costume back!\nNow all you have to do is deliver it to Mr. Lidi.\nLet's hurry back to the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_1_1,"Standing on stage\ndancing in the same costume as the person you admire...isn't it wonderful?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_2_1,"I managed to deliver the costume in time.I'm relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_2_2,"Then let's enjoy Lidi's dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_3_1,"That's Lidi's dance...\nI'm sure it's really beautiful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_4_1,"I'm going to the temple courtyard!\nSince you asked me to come watch the dance,\nI can't even look for junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_5_1,"I completely understand how you want to get closer to the person you admire."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_5_2,"When I become king someday, I will be like your father."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_6_1,"I see...that costume belongs to Janna...\nMr. Lidi respects Janna so much..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_6_2,"If Janna was alive\nI'm sure she would be happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_1_1,"Reedi's dance\nwas so amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_1_2,"I want to see you again somewhere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_2_1,"I can't believe that Zodera old man\nis encouraging Lidi over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_2_2,"...Heh, there are some good things about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_3_1,"Reedi's dance...\nI was really nervous when I fell down, but\nI'm glad I was able to dance till the end!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_3_2,"Thanks to the old man from Zodera."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_4_1,"That dancer named Lidi is well-suited to becoming popular.\nI don't think she has any connection with me, who likes to play."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_1,"Mr. {pc}....\nI'm really impressed right now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_2,"As the high priest said,\nI felt as if my soul had been shaken by Reedy's dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_3,"Yes.\nJanna's dancing was also very nice, but\nit was just as good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_1,"Those words from Mr. Zodera...\nThe performance ends when the audience applauds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_2,"...My journey as a hero will end when\nI defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora\nand the people can live in peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_3,"I can't afford to lose to Lidi!\nSo {pc}\nI look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_1_1,"It's my work tool, so\nI would probably notice\nthat I forgot my bag, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_2_1,"I'll pick up the\ntool bag at the ship management station south of Rendoa, then deliver it to the engineer at\nLagi Snowfield... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_2_2,"...It's a pain, but\nThat engineer must be in trouble too.\nLet's go to the ship management office first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_3_1,"I guess you can\ndeliver the tool bag that the engineer forgot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_4_1,"If you're an engineer, you probably have one or two pieces of junk\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_5_1,"The Grand Titus\nto the Kingdom of Gran Zedora\nseems to be going smoothly, which is great."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_5_2,"If Captain Abram is interested in this request,\nI would also like to cooperate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_6_1,"Captain Abram seemed to be quite concerned about\nconsidering it was just something he forgot...\nDid something happen?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_1,"In order to receive the tool bag,\nI need to find a high-tech spanner.\nA ghoul in the west of Guren territory... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_2,"I have visited the western part of Guren territory several times\nwith Arold. I think there were many strong monsters in the area where there were ghouls."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_3,"However, this was before we traveled together with {pc} and the others...\nIt shouldn't be too difficult for us now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_2_1,"You won't be able to do your job with a broken spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_2_2,"'Let's go get some high-tech spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}!\nLet's go get you\na high-tech spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_4_1,"You didn't do the work I was asked to do and forced you to\non me...\nThat's a lot of crap!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_1,"Why does a ghoul have a high-tech spanner\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_2,"Come on. You'll pick up anything that falls, like Duston's old man\n, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_3,"I don't pick up anything!\nJust useless junk!\nDon't underestimate me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_4,"It seems like…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_6_1,"It's a problem for the station staff as well.\nWe thought it was a boarding ship.\nLet's get the high-tech wrench too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_6_2,"I believe\nghouls sometimes drop high-tech spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_1_1,"I'm relieved that the captain and Mr. Pageo were able to make up."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_1_2,"It's definitely not good for things to go on like that... relations are strained."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_2_1,"It's so troublesome, the old men's fight has finally settled down."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_2_2,"Friendships that have been nurtured over a long period of time are not easily broken."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_3_1,"I'm glad that the captain and Vallejo were able to make up\nMr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_1,"It's your fault that the new device is better\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_2,"But thanks to that, we were able to go to\nLendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_3,"Pugy!\nI'll put up with it for Lendersia's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_5_1,"Thinking about things from a broader perspective...\nEven if you think you understand it, it's difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_1,"I'm glad I was able to help Captain Abram.\nI used to be indebted to the captain."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_2,"When I was little, I didn't like ships...\nI didn't even want to go on the Grand Titus.\nI complained a lot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_3,"But when the captain heard\nhe stayed by my side the whole time...\nHe told me fun stories about the sea until we arrived at the port."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_4,"Since then, I feel comfortable going on the ship.\nI am still very grateful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_5,"Someday, if I have a chance, I will tell you the sea story that the captain told me.\nIt was a really fun story!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_1_1,"Let's take the high-tech spanner to\nMr. Yakkoi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_2_1,"With this high-tech wrench,\ntechnicians will have no trouble doing maintenance work."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_3_1,"It seems like a high-tech spanner will\nwork faster than a regular spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_4_1,"A useful spanner for free\nis high-tech and shiny...\nIt's the worst!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_5_1,"I see...\nThere are many different types of spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_6_1,"Now all you have to do is pick up your tool bag at the ship control station and deliver it to the\nengineer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_1_1,"Regardless of the reason, we're still friends\nso it's better to make up before we get stuck."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_1_2,"...before the relationship gets strained and we end up hurting each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_2_1,"For what reason did the captain and the engineer, who were polite adults, fight\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_2_2,"I heard that Engineer Pageo and Captain Abram have been friends for decades.\nI hope their relationship doesn't deteriorate like this..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_3_1,"I'm trying to have the tool bag delivered to Mr. Vallejo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_3_2,"The captain is also aware that things can't go on like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_4_1,"If you were to replace it with a high-tech spanner,\nyou wouldn't hand over your broken spanner to me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_5_1,"It's a nice gesture to\nreplace a broken wrench when delivering something you forgot to someone you had a fight with."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_6_1,"I thought Captain Abram was\na calm person, but\nhe gets into big fights..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_1_1,"Both the captain and Mr. Pageo\nare clumsy people who can't express their feelings in words."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_1_2,"...Hehe, I remembered\nArold and Giganf."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_2_1,"Kindness is something you do\nwithout even realizing it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_2_2,"I think it would have been good if\nthe old man from Pageo realized that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_3_1,"I guess Mr. Vallejo and the captain had different feelings and got into a fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_3_2,"It's hard to be friends when trying to please someone\nends up in a fight...\nIt's hard to be friends."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_4_1,"The best thing about tools is that they are bare!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_5_1,"I thought the exchange of spanners was a courtesy, but\nit turned out to be a message from the captain.\nFriendship is difficult..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_6_1,"I'm really glad that we were able to reconcile the two of you with our help.\nAll that's left now is to report to Captain Abram."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_1,"When you admire someone you like, it feels like\nI don't really understand, but\nI admire you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_2,"Lord Arold…………\nLord Arro…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_3,"No, I'm a little embarrassed!\nNow, let's quickly collect the toad oil and\nbones of the ancient dragon to make the flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_2_1,"Is it Kuro this time...\nIsn't it Kuro from Clover?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_2_2,"I can't help but doubt it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_3_1,"I want to support Sinon's love.\nLet's do everything we can!\nDear {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_4_1,"I'm not interested in things like love, but\nYou're a lot more polished than last time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_5_1,"Kuro...?\nI'm a little concerned, but\nLet's prioritize gathering materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_6_1,"I'm a little jealous.\nI wonder what it feels like to make an effort for the person you love."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_1_1,"Now, Sinon will be able to make\na flute for Kuro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_1_2,"I don't know what kind of flute it will be made from the oil of the cattail and the bones of the ancient dragon\n, but...\nI'm sure Kuro will like it too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_2_1,"I'll take the toad oil and the bones of the ancient dragon and return to\nSinon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_2_2,"What kind of guy is\nasking me to make a flute out of something like this...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_3_1,"I wonder what kind of flute Mr. Sinon is planning to make with the oil of the cattail and the bones of the ancient dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_3_2,"It's hard to imagine just looking at the materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_4_1,"I'd rather have the fish bones\nafter they've eaten than the precious bones of ancient dragons!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_5_1,"If you make a flute with these bones,\nwhat kind of sound will it make?\nI'm a little curious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_6_1,"The only thing left to do is deliver\nthe materials for the flute to Sinon, the maiden in love.\nGama's oil... Did you have it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_1_1,"I'm sure Sinon can make\na wonderful flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_1_2,"I hope you can convey your feelings to Kuro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_2_1,"...Sinon can only see Kuro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_3_1,"Sinon, you really love Kuro.I hope Kuro will like the flute that Sinon made."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_4_1,"Even if I make it according to the instructions, the whistle doesn't make a proper sound!\nThat guy named Kuro\ndoes a pretty good job."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_5_1,"The pendulum of fate has\npower again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_5_2,"Is there any connection between Sinon's love and our fate?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_6_1,"I hope Kuro will be happy with the flute that Sinon makes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_6_2,"Anyway, Kuro is a name I heard somewhere."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_1_1,"By helping those in need,\nI was able to gather the power of destiny, so\nI was able to kill two birds with one stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_1_2,"Killing three birds with one stone by exterminating monsters and strengthening your body?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_2_1,"Delivering a hot spring souvenir to an old man\nCleaning up after a fight between older adults...\nWill something like this change fate?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_2_2,"If it helped someone\nthat's fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_3_1,"...Reedy's dance was beautiful.\nI want to see it again. Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_3_2,"For that reason, we must use the power of the pendulum of fate to stop the Great Demon King's plan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_1,"Even though I was just helping them make strange musical instruments,\nthe power of destiny came together..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_2,"As expected, the former Potsucon 2 is destined to summon the ponkotsu!\nThere was no madness in my eyes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_3,"...Since the old man is following me,\nI can't say it was a mistake."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_5_1,"Compared to the time I visited the true world's Melsandi Cered\nArahagiro,\nthere were no major incidents."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_5_2,"Even if each event is small,\nthe accumulation of them may change\na huge flow that can be called destiny."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_6_1,"Looks like the pendulum of fate is full of power again.\nLet's go back to report to Lady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_1_1,"Hurry up and chase Anlucia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_1_2,"Mr. Anlucia's face looks demonic....\nIt's dangerous to let her go like that...\nLet's hurry to Solaria Canyon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_2_1,"Anlucia guy, don't think about the future\nDon't jump out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_2_2,"Quickly, let's chase down\nAnlucia to Solaria Canyon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_3_1,"We have to stop Anlucia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_3_2,"Let's go to Solaria Canyon! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_4_1,"I can't believe you left without thinking\nThere's more to see than I expected!\nI'm going too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_5_1,"Astortia's hope is to be a hero...\nNo, even if she is not a hero\nPrincess Anlucia is our friend!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_5_2,"We can't afford to lose you,\n{pc}! Hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_1_1,"I hope you go back to your usual Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_1_2,"It's dangerous to leave you alone.\nLet's follow!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_2_1,"That Milt guy...\nHe seemed to hate Anlucia, but\nHe protected her from monster attacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_2_2,"What's wrong with my friend...\nWhat happened?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_3_1,"I think Lady Anlucia is preoccupied with\nthe prince's Kataki...\nThat's why we have to support her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_4_1,"Not once, but twice!\nWell, I can't lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_1,"What exactly is that technique that {pc} used to protect\nPrincess Anlucia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_2,"...I see.\n{pc} doesn't really understand either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_3,"It seems that Lushenda has noticed what that is\n, but...\nRight now, we should go after Princess Anlucia first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_1_1,"If {pc} is an ally of the hero,\nI would like you to train me, even though I am still lacking in ability."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_2_1,"{pc} is an ally of the hero...\nYou have taken on a very important role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_3_1,"The hero's ally,\n{pc}, was\nan amazing person after all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_1,"I can't believe that you, the former Potsucon 2, were anything but an ally of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_2,"Even though you look so absent-minded,\nI missed you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_3,"However, if I stay with you,\nI'm sure I'll meet some crap and crap, so\nI have no choice but to follow you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_1,"{pc} is an ally of the hero...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_2,"Not only the technique that protected Princess Anlucia\n, but also the encounter with us, the battle with Hades Nergel\n, and the fact that he has helped many people..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_3,"All of them are the guides of fate to fight against the Great Demon King Madesagora as allies of the hero\n...If you think about it that way, it makes sense."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_1,"…………{pc}.\nI'll only confide in you, but it's me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_2,"When I found out that the masked man was Big Brother Toma, I was really happy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_3,"That's not Big Brother Toma anymore.\nI understand. But..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_4,"...I'm sorry. I found out that the Great Demon King's target was\nGod's Scarlet Stone.\nI have to be strong..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_5,"'Thank you {pc}.\nI'm glad I talked to you.\nI'm fine now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_1_1,"Mr. Anlucia...\nWhen you found out that your brother was the masked man,\nyou must have been very shocked..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_2_1,"The masked man's true identity is\nAnlucia's big brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_2_2,"Even though I know we are the enemy,\nI feel heavy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_3_1,"The reunion between Princess Anlucia and Prince Thomas will be\npainful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_3_2,"My breasts are hurting too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_4_1,"I can't forgive you for trying to use a dead person as a tool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_5_1,"To resurrect Prince Thoma and use him to manipulate\nand invade the world..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_5_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle to think of countermeasures\nand meet up with Princess Anlucia and the others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_1_1,"The same mirror may be stored in the treasure vault of Arahagiro Castle in the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_1_2,"Isn't it worth\nto go?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_1,"King Sama is as careless as ever.\nI'm concerned about the God's Scarlet Stone, but\nWith the way things are going, I feel like I have no choice but to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_2,"But a shattered mirror cannot be repaired."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_3,"For now, why don't you go to the fake Arahagiro Castle\n?\nYou might find something similar."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_3_1,"King Moonis is so clumsy that even I get worried sometimes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_4_1,"That means you can't use the broken mirror anymore, right?\nI'll take it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_5_1,"It seems that the Arahagiro Kingdom is in\nfinancial trouble due to the war, so\nKing Moonis must have been in a panic."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_5_2,"As a prince,\nI cannot leave the suffering people of other countries alone.\nLet's go find the mirror of the phantom sun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_6_1,"I wanted to ask if King Moonis knows anything about the Scarlet Stone of God."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_6_2,"But I wonder if there is a replacement for the special mirror\nkept in the treasure vault of the Arahagiro Kingdom...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_1_1,"Looks like the Bone Knight\ntook the mirror away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_1_2,"Fortunately, the mirror I got back said\nthat I can do whatever I want with it, so let's go find the Bone Knight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_1,"It's good to know that the mirror that King Moonis broke is\nin the false world of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_2,"I can't believe a monster took it away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_3,"Looks like we have no choice but to look for\nthe Bone Knight that the treasure room keeper told us about."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_3_1,"The same mirror existed in the false world of Arahagiro too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_3_2,"If we recover it from the monsters and give it to you,\nKing Moonis will feel at ease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_4_1,"Does that mean that the treasure in the treasury has become\njunk because no one needs it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_4_2,"Hmm...but it's a treasure, so someone might want\nsomeday... I'm at a loss as to whether or not to get it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_5_1,"The kingdom of Arahagiro in the fake world was ruled by\nBermud, so it can't be helped that the country would be in chaos after his death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_5_2,"I wonder if the people guarding the treasure house were also tired due to the domestic turmoil..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_6_1,"I have mixed feelings about the fact that the false world created by the Great Demon King can help save the people of the true world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_6_2,"Anyway, we have to recover the Mirror of Phantom Sun from the Bone Knight in the Arahagiro region of the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_1_1,"I want to try Shiny Melon too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_2_1,"I hope that by growing shiny melons,\nthe Arahagiro Kingdom's finances will be restored as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_2_2,"If it's a king like King Moonis who cares about the people, it'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_3_1,"I wonder what Shiny Melon tastes like\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_3_2,"Let's all eat together sometime! Mr.\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_4_1,"I thought you were a piece of crap like breaking a mirror, but\nyou were trying to protect the world...\nI was fooled too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_5_1,"King Moonis'\ngood fortune until he obtained the treasure was probably bestowed upon him by his ancestors."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_5_2,"In addition to Shiny Melons,\nKing Moonis' ancestors also gave us\ntreasures."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_6_1,"If you leave the rest to King Moonis\n, everything will be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_6_2,"That's what your father said before.\nKing Moonis is a good king who takes\nhis country seriously..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_1_1,"I was saved because there was a mirror like\nin the false world of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_1_2,"If this mirror is unbroken,\nwe might be able to enter the Stone Chamber of the Sun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_2_1,"I need to take\nto King Moonis quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_2_2,"Aren't you crying by now because the minister is pestering you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_3_1,"Dear {pc}!\nLet's deliver the mirror to King Moonis!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_4_1,"If I bring you a mirror, will you give me\nsome junk in return?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_5_1,"I'm glad we found the same thing as the broken mirror.\nThis is a problem that affects many people living in the Kingdom of Arahagiro in the true world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_6_1,"Will I be able to use the mirror of this false world to put\ninto the true world's hidden treasure?\nI tried to retrieve it, but I'm a little worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_6_2,"I think\nthe Scarlet Stone of the God may be in the Sun's Stone Chamber where the treasure is hidden."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_1_1,"I think {pc} would be able to\ndance without being shy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_2_1,"Is there a mechanism in the pyramid that reacts to dancing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_2_2,"{pc} Can't you dance properly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_3_1,"{pc}'s dance...\nI might really want to see it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_4_1,"Is this a pyramid where treasure is hidden?\nI'm not interested in ordinary treasures, but\nOld junk is most welcome!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_5_1,"If there is a God's Scarlet Stone in the Sunstone Chamber,\nmonsters may attack.\nI'm worried about King Moonis and others who went there first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_6_1,"I see there's a mechanism that reacts to dancing.\nI wonder if the person who made it liked dancing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_1_1,"Your ancestors left a treasure\nto your descendant, King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_2_1,"...Wouldn't it be no good if the king of the country, Sama, sold the\nGod's Scarlet Stone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_2_2,"I thought\nthat if it would make the country and people rich...\nThat's a difficult problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_3_1,"I'm glad King Moonis and I found Shiny Melon\n. Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_4_1,"I've been looking for some good junk, but it doesn't seem to be there!\nYou just have to get out of a place like this quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_5_1,"Like King Moonis's ancestors, I want to be able to\nextend a helping hand to my descendants when they are in trouble."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_6_1,"I'm glad that I was able to protect\nthe Pyramid God's Scarlet Stone\nwith everyone in 『Shield of the Hero』."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_6_2,"I never thought\nthat King Moonis would want to sell\nthe God Scarlet Stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_1_1,"A hot spring...\nSometimes I want to relax and relieve the fatigue of my travels."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_2_1,"It's a problem that\npeople can't come to the hot springs because of monsters..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_2_2,"Even though I came here to rest my body,\nI can't stay in the hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_3_1,"Even monsters make me want to take a bath in a hot spring..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_4_1,"I was really disappointed in the former Potsucon 2 who helped people over and over again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_5_1,"If monsters remain in the hot springs like this,\nother people won't be able to use the hot springs, and\nLuzina won't be able to do her job as a manager."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_5_2,"Let's go to the hot springs quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_1,"Gal...Anyway,\nI'm worried that some people will be attacked by monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_2,"And there must have been\nan old shrine in Montserro Hot Springs Valley...\nThe Scarlet Stone of the Gods might be there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_3,"Maybe the monster that appeared was aiming for\nthe Scarlet Stone of God?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_1_1,"Since we have to deal with multiple monsters,\nthis time it would be better to watch\nthe opponent's movements more than usual!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_2_1,"They're really laid-back guys who don't want to take a dip in a hot spring before fighting."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_3_1,"I want to go to a hot spring too...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_4_1,"A place like a hot spring that heals people and even cleans them\nis not a good place!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_4_2,"Quickly defeat it and leave\nfrom here!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_5_1,"It was a monster that talked nonsense, but\nthe way it carried itself when it ran away\nwasn't normal."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_5_2,"Be careful and follow us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_6_1,"We cannot let God's scarlet stone be crushed!\n{pc}! Let's hurry to the shrine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_1_1,"The scarlet stone of God will continue to protect\nfor a long time..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_1_2,"As Luzina trains\na successor,\nhistory will be woven again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_2_1,"... Yakupu's old man\nIf you open his mouth, he'll only talk about gals."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_2_2,"...Well, if that's what makes you feel competitive about living,\nthat's fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_3_1,"In the past, the guardian of the hot springs protected\nthe Scarlet Stone of the Gods, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_3_2,"Thanks to the guardians of the hot springs,\nthe Scarlet Stone of God and the hot springs are still\ncherished."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_4_1,"Not only is it useful, but there's water all over the place\nThe hot springs are already a mess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_5_1,"As the successor of the Megistris Kingdom,\nI have to learn more..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_6_1,"Now that Luzina has reminded me of\nmy role as the guardian of the hot springs, I can safely entrust\nthe Scarlet Stone of God."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_1_1,"I defeated the monster that came to the hot spring.\nLet's go to Yakup and report."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_2_1,"Now that we've defeated the demons that are the Great Demon King's minions, let's hurry back to Yakup's old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_2_2,"...The steam and heat will make you sweat even more."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_3_1,"It's full of monsters. Enjoy the hot springs\nIt's so sneaky!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_4_1,"It healed the body and had sacred stones...\nIt was an unpleasant hot spring that was useful for people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_5_1,"I was able to defeat the monsters and pour\npower into the God's Scarlet Stone,\nso other people can also relax in the hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_5_2,"Let's go to Meln Watermill Village and tell Mr. Yakup about what happened at\nthe hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_1,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_2,"Oh {pc}?\nSorry. It's nothing.\nI was just thinking..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_3,"More than that, I'm glad we were able to protect\nthe Scarlet Stone of the Gods at Montserro Hot Springs Gorge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_4,"Even the Great Demon King Madesagora\ncannot touch the God's Scarlet Stone, which is protected by the power of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_5,"...Even so, the two Akuma generals were\nformidable enemies. In many ways..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_1_1,"It seems that the priests are not free, so\nwe should bring the spark for purification."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_2_1,"Do I have to go to the trouble of\na prayer ceremony to go to the place where the Tenkan is sitting?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_2_2,"Being a priest is tough."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_3_1,"If you use the purification spark dropped by the Twisted Torch,\nthe door to the Throne of Vow will open."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_3_2,"It feels strange that the fire dropped by monsters is helping the high priests."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_4_1,"It's an inconvenient place where you can't open the entrance unless you prepare the tools and perform the ritual!\nI've reconsidered it a bit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_5_1,"The purification spark is said to be necessary for the Dharma Temple ritual, so\nlet's do what we can to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_6_1,"I thought {pc} would help the High Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_6_2,"Besides, the Dharma Temple is\none of the most sacred places in Rendarcia, so it might have something to do with the Scarlet Stone of the Gods."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_1_1,"Now that I have obtained the spark of purification,\nthe High Priest will be able to\nperform the prayer ceremony."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_1_2,"Let's go back to Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_2_1,"Let's deliver the spark of purification to High Priest Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_3_1,"This is the\nspark of purification that the High Priest needs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_3_2,"Let's get it quickly! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_4_1,"Even though fire is a free thing,\nit can be useful for many things, but\nI'm not interested in fire needed for important rituals!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_5_1,"It's a blue, gentle fire...\nAs the name suggests,\nit seems to have a mysterious power that cleanses impurities."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_6_1,"Come to think of it, I…\nAs the princess of Gran Zedora, I didn't greet the high priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_6_2,"Last time you seemed busy with the appointment ceremony, so\nI had to give you a proper greeting when I handed you the spark of purification."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_1_1,"Thanks to the god Granzenis entrusting the\nstone to the god Dharma,\nwe have been protected and have survived."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_1_2,"Let us be thankful for the friendship of the gods."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_2_1,"After making the High Priest Sama immobile,\nI can't believe you're going to make it so that no one can see her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_2_2,"That monster was quite cautious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_3_1,"I'm relieved that the real High Priest has been found\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_3_2,"You're trying to switch places with the high priest\nYou're a cunning monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_4_1,"It's a pity that the object of worship is not a piece of junk, but\nit's a memento of a friend of the deities, so I can't be so stingy with it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_5_1,"The High Priest is safe and\nthe god's scarlet stone has regained\nits power from the age of the gods, so it's a relief."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_6_1,"{pc}.I'll say it now, but\nThe battle with the Phantom General was tough.\nI was so busy that I was dizzy because of the Phantom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_6_2,"But I'm glad we were able to protect the Scarlet Stone of the God of Dharma Temple\n.\nThe High Priest was safe too, so we'll be fine now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_1_1,"To have a dream in which the High Priest\ndestroys Dharma's divine object...\nis somehow ominous."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_1_2,"Let's go check out the deity."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_2_1,"If Dharma's divine object is really the divine scarlet stone,\nthe dream that Grand Priest Sama had\nI hope doesn't actually happen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_2_2,"If we go to the Vow Seat,\nwe might be able to stop it.\nLet's go."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_3_1,"Dharma's divine body wanted to\ntell the high priest\nthat he was in danger through his dream?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_3_2,"Even though I can't talk to you directly,\nI can see it in my dreams and let you know.\nAs expected of a deity."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_4_1,"Are you going to a place where there are things that are cherished by everyone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_4_2,"If you have some junk,\nyou can take it with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_5_1,"Indeed, the Dharma Temple is a suitable place to protect\nthe Scarlet Stone of God."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_5_2,"After all, Dr. Rossum said that\nit is a keystone that protects the land of Lendersia from evil beings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_6_1,"Maybe my hunch was right.\nI'm also curious about the high priest's dream.\nLet's go to the ritual room in the basement of the temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_1_1,"Dharma's sacred object may really be\nthe Scarlet Stone of God.\nLet's go to the Throne of the Vow as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_2_1,"It's not easy to go to the Throne of Vow when it's so strictly controlled."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_3_1,"It seems difficult for monsters to enter\nthe Seat of Vow unless the high priest performs a ritual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_4_1,"Is the ritual over?\nIn that case, let's go see if there is any junk in the place called the throne of prayer!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_5_1,"If it is necessary to perform such a ritual just to enter the throne of the Divine Vow\nthen the scarlet stone of the god may be the object of worship."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_6_1,"Let's go to the Seat of Vow too.\nIf we have the God's Scarlet Stone, we have to pour\nthe power of the hero into it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_1_1,"A monster disguised as a high priest\nwas deceiving us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_1_2,"I'm worried about the safety of the real high priest!\nLet's find him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_2_1,"I don't think you would go to the trouble of disguising yourself as the High Priest Sama and get in our way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_2_2,"Where is the real High Priest Sama...?\nWe need to find him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_3_1,"The high priest who was disguised as a monster\nlooked just like the real thing, so\nI didn't notice it at all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_4_1,"It's a pain to enter, but\nIt's a terrible room with no junk!\nThe Dharma Temple is full of things like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_5_1,"I can't let my guard down at all for a monster disguised as a high priest to perform\na prayer ceremony."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_5_2,"The battle would have been dangerous if Princess Anlucia had not mastered\n'Eye of the Hero.''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_6_1,"I'm glad I arrived in time to restore\nthe power of the Age of Gods to the divine scarlet stone of the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_6_2,"Now we just have to make sure the high priest is safe.\nLet's go look for him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_1_1,"There is a\nsecret meeting room in the basement of Gran Zedora Castle... If you look for this castle\n, it seems like there are many secrets."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_2_1,"...The secret technique of destroying evil.\nThe test from the sage Sama means\nIt must be an amazing technique."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_3_1,"From my point of view, Ms. Anlucia\nis still strong enough, but by learning the secret technique of destroying evil,\nshe must become even stronger..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_3_2,"Dear {pc}, I will also\ndo my best to become stronger!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_4_1,"Are you going to the trouble of\nfixing the broken device?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_4_2,"Why don't I take the broken one and make a new one?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_5_1,"I can't believe there's even a\nsecret conference room for convening wise men.\nAs expected from the Kingdom of Gran Zedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_6_1,"Learn the secret technique of destroying evil... To do that,\nFirst, we need to repair the device in the secret conference room.\nLet's talk to Mr. Milt."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_1_1,"In order to summon the wise men,\nwe need to fix the equipment in the conference room as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_1_2,"Let's go to the Lagi Snowfield."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_2_1,"...That troublesome old man.\nI agree that he's a proud engineer.\nBut... I have no choice but to go."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_3_1,"Mr. Vallejo is the old man who\nhad a fight with the captain of the\nGrand Titus, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_3_2,"I'm related to Lushenda by blood.\nBut I don't look anything like Lushenda at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_4_1,"Ah...I replaced the broken wrench with a shiny, high-tech wrench\nWhen we talked about what a waste it was..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_5_1,"I see.The way we met back then has led us here...\nThe guidance of the pendulum of fate is amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_6_1,"It's Mr. Vallejo, the engineer.\nHe has a somewhat similar atmosphere to Mr. Hollow, so\nI remember him well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_1_1,"If Mr. Vallejo already knows\nwhere the equipment in the secret conference room is broken, then it's time to talk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_1_2,"Defeat the killer machine and get the magic lens\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_1,"It seems that the old engineer\nknew that the equipment in the conference room was broken, so did we need to go and ask him?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_2,"Even if you leave it alone, it will come eventually."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_3,"It's an emergency right now, so\nyou can't say that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_3_1,"Mr. Vallejo, we knew from the beginning that the device was broken."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_3_2,"In that case, I think you can fix it as soon as you gather the materials\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_4_1,"If I remember correctly, you did\nsomething like this before going to Lendersia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_4_2,"Let's finish this quickly and go back to finding Lendersia's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_5_1,"Now that I think about it, when I met Mr. Vallejo before, he was worried about the equipment at Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_1,"I'm glad\nthat I can get what I need for repairs soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_2,"Now, {pc}.\nThe first task for the hero and his ally."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_3,"It's fine that we get along, but\ndon't forget that we are here."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_4,"Hehehe.\nWe are important friends.\nOf course we all rely on you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_1_1,"Lushenda...?\nEven from my point of view, Lushenda\nlooks young...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_2_1,"Finally, we can begin the\ntrials to make the princess stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_2_2,"...I think we can also train ourselves by protecting the princess, so I'm looking forward to it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_1,"The device in the secret conference room can\nproject people far away and talk to them. It's amazing that you can\nrepair such a device right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_2,"But Lushenda\nMr. Vallejo's Hiiba...\nIs this some kind of joke?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_3,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_4_1,"What is that device?!\nI don't want to be anywhere near something that could be useful!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_5_1,"...Huh?\nDid I just say that I saw the truth?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_5_2,"Uh...\nI...I can't answer anything from my mouth..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_6_1,"The time has finally come to learn\nthe secret techniques of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_6_2,"Can I leave it to\n{pc} to decide which Sage's trial to start with?\nI want you to decide."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_1_1,"Let's go to the conference room with the magic lens!\nMr. Vallejo should have arrived as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_2_1,"I got the magic lens, so let's quickly deliver it to the conference room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_3_1,"If you have a magical lens, you can repair the device."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_3_2,"Let's go to the conference room quickly! Mr.\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_4_1,"I can't believe that such a strange glass plate would be useful for repair work...\nIt's not cool at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_5_1,"Mr. Vallejo is heading to\nGran Zedora Castle once he is finished preparing, so\nwe should also go to the secret meeting room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_6_1,"Once the equipment in the secret meeting room has been repaired,\nyou can finally try to master the hero's secret techniques.\nLet's prepare to take the test."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_1_1,"'Hero's Eye'...\nIf Anlucia can master this,\nit will be reassuring for us too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_1_2,"Let's go to the\nmonster fighting arena in the Arahagiro Kingdom of the true world!\nI'm sure there will be great trials awaiting us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_2_1,"Even if you think you won't be fooled by monsters' deceptions, you can still fall for\ntricks..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_2_2,"Being too confident in yourself may not be a good thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_3_1,"A technique to break through the deceit of monsters....\nAnlucia has mastered\na difficult technique..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_4_1,"You're trying to deprive me of the pleasure of being ripped off with a lie...\nDo you have a grudge against me?!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_5_1,"What on earth is Broggen's trial\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_1,"By discerning the truth or falsehood of things\nA technique to break through the lies created by monsters\nThe Eye of the Hero''..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_2,"No matter how much power you have,\nif you are fooled by deceit,\nyou will not be able to win the battle against the monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_3,"I think it will be useful\nin our future battles."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_1_1,"I can't believe you were able to\ndefeat such a formidable monster with\nAnlucia's cooperation..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_1_2,"The power of a hero and his ally is immeasurable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_2_1,"...That guy named Berorin Man\nwas quite a formidable enemy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_2_2,"There are only monsters prepared by the sage.\nTrial monsters are strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_3_1,"To me, real monsters and fake monsters\nlook the same, but\nAnlucia is amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_4_1,"I don't understand how you can go out of your way to see through something that is more useless than the real thing.\nIt's a fake!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_5_1,"It's truly a secret technique to break down\na fake that is indistinguishable from the real thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_6_1,"Thanks to everyone,\nI was able to acquire the Hero's Eye''.\nNow I don't have to be afraid of deception anymore."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_1_1,"Between poisonous fangs...sounds dangerous.\nI'm worried about being poisoned, but\nLet's keep our heads together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_2_1,"The old man in Eidos is a poison test...\nThe one in the Poison Fang Room seems creepy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_2_2,"I need the princess to clear the trials and become even stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_3_1,"I wonder if it's a test using poison...?\nIt feels kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_4_1,"The Poison Fang Room! What a wonderful name!\nThere must be a lot of helpless junk lying around\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_5_1,"Maybe in the Popora region of the Pukland continent...\nI never thought I would return to Pukland for the trial of the evil-destroying technique."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_6_1,"'Hero's Shield'... It's a technique that protects not only me but\n{pc} and everyone else.\nIt would be very reassuring if I could learn it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_6_2,"I have already experienced how difficult it is to fight alone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_1_1,"If we didn't have Mr. Anlucia's Shield of the Hero,''\nwe would have been attacked by the monster's poison."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_1_2,"The power of the hero\nis great after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_2_1,"That guy from Anlucia, after overcoming the trials\nhe really became stronger..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_2_2,"We also want to emulate Princess Anlucia and become even stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_3_1,"Fighting a poisonous monster was\nscary, but Anlucia protected me\nso I could fight with peace of mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_4_1,"Well, it was a nice cave full of poison!\nIt would have been better if there were some junk, but\nI'll forgive you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_5_1,"No matter how much you train your body,\nit's difficult to overcome poison, so\nI'm sure it will help you in your future battles."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_1,"...Hey {pc}.\nI was able to acquire the Hero's Shield'', but\nI really wanted to say something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_2,"At that time, all my thoughts about wanting to learn techniques\ndisappeared somewhere\nand all I thought about was protecting everyone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_3,"I was able to realize once again that the desire to protect one's friends\ngives birth to such great power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_4,"I want to be able to protect more and more people.\nThat is my role as a hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_1_1,"I'm more worried about Hollow than about the trial."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_1_2,"Even though he's a wise man, he's still an old man.\nI'd be worried if he got caught up in the trouble.\nLet's go find the old man!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_2_1,"The hollow old man\nI bet he was found by the Demon King's minions..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_2_2,"If that's the case, Hollow is\nin danger!\nLet's go find him right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! It's tough!\nLet's go to Mr. Hollow quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_4_1,"Isn't it just that the device is broken again?\nIf that's the case, don't try to repair it this time.\nIs it okay if I take it for you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_5_1,"Mr. Hollow looked as if he was\nfighting with someone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_5_2,"As Milt said,\nit would be better to check on Mr. Hollow's safety."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_1,"That Hollow looked so flustered...\nSomething might have happened."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_2,"{pc}!\nHurry up and find Mr. Hollow!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_3,"...But where are you?\nThe last time I met you was\non the Earth Ark..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_1_1,"I'm relieved that Hollow is safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_1_2,"...There is no guarantee that the Great Demon King will not interfere..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_2_1,"...There's also the Anlucia trial, and\nI need Sage Sama to stay healthy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_2_2,"He's a grandpa, so\nI was really worried..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_3_1,"Even the wise man could get hurt\n.\nI was worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_3_2,"You were your usual energetic enamel.\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_4_1,"I'm making you guys worry.\nActually, you're fine, you're such a bother!\nI'm starting to like you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_5_1,"I'm glad that Hollow was uninjured and seems to be doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_5_2,"I heard that the trial of the secret skill of destroying evil will be held on the top floor of Rinja Tower in the true world.\nLet's head there too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_6_1,"Share your heart of courage with your friends\nThe secret skill of drawing out great power, Heart of the Hero''...\nI want to learn it no matter what."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_6_2,"Raising the power of your allies is\nthe perfect secret technique for us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_1_1,"When I see Anlucia overcome her ordeal and become stronger\n, I feel motivated too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_2_1,"...The enamel old man is\nreally a free and wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_3_1,"I feel like my heart has become\nstronger than it was before the journey began!\nThanks to everyone and {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_4_1,"A magical statue that confuses people!\nI would rather have that\nthan a secret technique!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_4_2,"Oh no, it's just too much of a hindrance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_5_1,"Share your heart of courage with your friends...\nIt's much more amazing than I imagined.\nIt's truly a secret technique only available to the brave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_1,"I was able to acquire the Heart of a Hero'' thanks to\nyou, my ally, and everyone\nfighting together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_2,"Even if I am called a hero,\nthere is a limit to what I can do by myself.\nThis trial made me realize once again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_3,"But, I thought that if we all combined our\npowers, there would be no enemy\nthat we could not defeat."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_4,"From now on, let's all work together and fight\nthe army of the Great Demon King!\nNice to meet you {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_1_1,"Unlucia's power will lead to\ndefeating the Great Demon King, so\nlet's hurry up and take the next trial!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_2_1,"Hurry up and take the next test.\nThe wise old men are waiting for you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\nI wonder what kind of test we will face next?\nI have to do my best to become even stronger!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_4_1,"I don't want to use the sage all the time, but\nIt's not bad to be able to see rare things.\nI'll keep going!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_5_1,"There are still trials left, so\nPrincess Anlucia can become even stronger.\nWe can't afford to lose either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_6_1,"{pc}.\nWhen you are ready, take the next trial."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_1_1,"I can't take advantage of Milt's\nsadness after losing his precious friend...!\nI can't forgive him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_2_1,"...Did Milt give the prince's body to\nthe demons...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_2_2,"It's unforgivable, but\nhe must have had his own\nconflicts..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_3_1,"Milt was so worried that he wanted to hand over the body to the demons and cling to the dead Prince Thoma."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_4_1,"Even a seemingly talented person named Milt was actually a piece of crap who would be fooled by demons."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_4_2,"But you're useless and trying to beat me is 100 years too soon!\nYou're coming back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_5_1,"I once tried to bring\nmy father back to life with the power of the wish-fulfilling notebook, so perhaps I don't have the qualification to say\nanything..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_5_2,"However,\nI will never allow you to use the sadness of losing a loved one for your own ambitions!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_1,"...I once wanted to become an ally of the hero Big Brother Toma and support him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_2,"But the truth is that I am a hero and my brother supported me.\nAnd my brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_3,"But now {pc}.\nYou and my friends are here as allies.\nThat's why I can still fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_4,"As a hero, I will defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora and free Big Brother Toma.\nUntil then, I will never give up."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_5,"Stay by my side until the end.\n{pc}…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_1_1,"The monsters that tried to destroy the God's Scarlet Stone were all powerful enemies that could not be defeated without\nAnlucia's power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_2_1,"...We managed to protect the remaining God's Scarlet Stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_3_1,"The enemy monsters were all strong, but\nwe also became strong, so we were able to protect the God's Scarlet Stone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_4_1,"I was so useless that God somehow protected me, but since I found all kinds of junk, I will forgive you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_5_1,"I'm glad I was able to protect all three of the remaining Scarlet Stones of the Gods."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_5_2,"I hope this will stop the erosion of the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_6_1,"We were finally able to regain the\npower of the three remaining God Scarlet Stones.\nLet's go back to report to Lady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_1_1,"You are planning to block our path by destroying the pendulum of fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_1_2,"Let's go to Solaria Canyon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_2_1,"You Demon King...\nI'm sure he's not planning something\nthat isn't even Roku..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_3_1,"The pendulum of fate has been broken..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_3_2,"You're taking away all of our efforts..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_4_1,"A broken pendulum is useless!\nThen why don't you give it to me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_5_1,"...Let's go to Solaria Canyon.\nWhere the Pendulum of Fate led\nbefore it was destroyed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_5_2,"Even if the pendulum is broken, we have no choice but to\nfollow the path shown."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_1,"The pendulum of fate may be broken, but\nthat doesn't mean our destiny is broken as well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_2,"As Lucenda said,\nYou must create your own destiny!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_3,"'Let's head to Solaria Canyon right away.\nI'm sure something is going on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_4,"If fate is\nheading in the wrong direction, let us guide you\nto the right path!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_1_1,"It's different from the previous Solaria Canyon...\nThere's a sense of unease here."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_1_2,"I'm scared, but for everyone's sake\nI have to go...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_2_1,"...What is that creepy thing?\nLast time I came here,\nnothing like that was floating in the sky."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_2_2,"The terrain has changed\nto something ominous...\nLet's keep our guard up and move on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_3_1,"Dear {pc}...\nI'm scared of Solaria Canyon right now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_3_2,"But since you and {pc} are here, I'll do my best..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_4_1,"What is that?! That place in the sky looks like there might be junk!\nYou should go there quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_5_1,"What is that\ndeceptive object floating in the sky?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_5_2,"...It seems better to proceed\ncarefully from here on out."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_6_1,"That deceptive object floating in the transformed Solaria Canyon...\nI need to investigate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_6_2,"It's okay.\nWhatever fate awaits us, we should be able to\nface it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_1_1,"Even if I show you the appearance of Hades Nergel,\n{pc} will not be afraid of\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_1_2,"You better not take us lightly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_2_1,"Hey! {pc}!\nI'm sure you understand, but\nI'm not going to lose to the embodiment of fear!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_2_2,"Let's defeat that guy who just looks like\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_3_1,"Even if something scary appears to me,\n{pc},\nI believe that you will not lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_4_1,"Former Potsukon No. 2, you can get over your own fears. It's boring, even if you're a person, I know that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_5_1,"{pc} can\novercome that fear!\nAbsolutely...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_6_1,"You will not be defeated by the fear lurking in your heart.\nI will help you again and again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_6_2,"I'm the same way. No matter what fear stands in my way,\nas long as you're by my side, I'll be fine.\nSo {pc} let's fight without giving up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_1,"I want to defeat the Great Demon King right away, but\nit's impossible unless I break the barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_2,"After all, we can't move forward here unless we borrow\nwisdom from Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_3,"...It's very sad to have to come all this way and start all over again, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_2_1,"Damn it...!\nWe're almost there until the Great Demon King\nWhy are you being hindered by a barrier like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_3_1,"If we don't enter the Demon Palace, we won't be able to defeat the Great Demon King!\nDear {pc}, I'm frustrated...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_1,"Is there\njunk in the Great Demon King's castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_2,"If that's the case,\nwe'll break in right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_3,"There's a barrier and I can't get through it.\nI'll talk to Lushenda, so\nI'll go back to Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_5_1,"You cannot defeat the Great Demon King unless you destroy the\nbarrier that blocks your path to the Great Demon King's throne."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_5_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle.\nI'm sure Lushenda will be able to give me some advice."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_1,"The power of the Great Demon King is immeasurable for him to be able to manifest the fear hidden in your heart into a monster like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_2,"But you didn't give in to that fear.\nAnd I and everyone else are with you.\nI'm sure you can defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_3,"But before that, we have to do something to\ncreate a barrier to protect the Phantom Palace...\nLet's talk to Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_1_1,"It would be reassuring if the sages of the Crown of Wisdom could\nlocate\nPegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_1_2,"Finding a Pegasus that we don't know may exist...\nIt's like catching a cloud..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_2_1,"Pegasus...?\nDoes such a creature\nexist in this world?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_2_2,"You may have only heard about it in fairy tales."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_3_1,"Does Pegasus really exist?\nIf so, I would really like to meet him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_4_1,"Are you looking for a horse that can fight bad guys and fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_4_2,"That horse...\nIt would be nice if it was a flop.\nIt seems like there's little hope..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_1_1,"If you can ride the flying dragon using the dragon flute that Mr. Crows gave you, you can go to the island of Etene, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_1_2,"But riding a flying dragon...\nYou're talking about Pegasus.\nYou mentioned another amazing creature."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_2_1,"It's a flute that controls flying dragons...\nThe Crows guy has\neverything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_2_2,"Earlier, a musical instrument craftsman on the beach of Kokorata was asked by a person named Kuro to make a special flute... Could that be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_3_1,"We're going to\nthe island of Ethene on a flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_3_2,"I wonder what kind of ride the Hiryu is like?\nWill I be able to ride it properly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_4_1,"It's the hometown of the former Potsucon No. 2, so\nI'm sure there's some good junk here!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_4_2,"Please guide me properly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_5_1,"Looks like the only way to land on the island of Ethene is to fly\nthrough the sky..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_5_2,"There's no other option.\nI'll blow the dragon flute that the Crows gave me and get\nthe flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_6_1,"Pegasus is healing the\nscars from his previous battle with the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_6_2,"...No. I'm also interested in Pegasus, but\nI need to find the wyvern first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_1_1,"Let's go to\nWyvern Peak to find your partner, the wyvern that Mr. Wandora said."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_2_1,"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of flying dragon\nwill be attracted by {pc}'s whistle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_3_1,"I wonder what kind of flying dragon will come...\nI hope it's a kind flying dragon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_4_1,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\nThe flying dragon you call should definitely be\na bare flying dragon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_4_2,"I would like to refrain from riding a bare dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_5_1,"Pegasus and the flying dragon...\nIt's too late now, but I feel like I've stepped into a fairy tale."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_5_2,"We've even met the fairy tale hero\nZankrone.\nIt's nothing surprising, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_6_1,"I will ask {pc}\nyou to play the dragon flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_6_2,"I...\nI'm not good at playing musical instruments."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_1_1,"The search for\nPegasus will now begin in earnest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_1_2,"In order to defeat the Great Demon King, we must quickly find\nPegasus!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_2_1,"The day will come when I will travel on a flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_2_2,"When you travel with {pc}, you never\nget bored."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_3_1,"Pegasus... where is he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_3_2,"I don't think it will be easy to find, but\nyou won't have to spend too much time\nlooking for it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_4_1,"Wherever the former Potsukon No. 2 goes,\nthere is usually\njunk that I like!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_4_2,"I'm going to go find a flying horse\nfor junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_5_1,"We're landing on the island of Ethene...\nThere's not much information about Pegasus, but\nWe'll definitely find it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_1,"The island of Ethene in the inland sea of ​​Lendersia...I wonder where on the island\nPegasus heals wounds?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_2,"I hope that you have regained enough power to fight alongside Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_3,"It was\na long time ago that Pegasus and the previous hero fought against the Great Demon King, right?\nThen wouldn't it be okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_1_1,"I didn't think {pc}'s flute tone was\nterrible, but\nHiryu and us feel it differently."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_2_1,"It looks like that white dragon will give you a flying dragon\n, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_2_2,"The sound of {pc}'s whistle\nseems to be pretty bad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_3_1,"The sound of {pc}'s flute...\nI didn't notice it though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_4_1,"You made that annoying whistle sound.\nAs expected of a former Potsucon No. 2!\nI've reconsidered you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_5_1,"Does that mean that the white dragon was\ninterested in {pc}'s strength?\nIt didn't seem to like the sound of the flute..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_5_2,"Let's go back\nto Mr. Wandora, the dragon protector. We have to check out the\ngood thing that the white dragon sent us earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_6_1,"You're such a rude dragon that the tone of {pc}'s dragon flute is boring or harsh!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_6_2,"If that doesn't work,\nIf I blow it,\nI don't know how much people will criticize it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_1_1,"I never expected the white dragon from earlier to\ngive me such a magnificent egg..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_1_2,"I wonder if you\ntrusted us unexpectedly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_2_1,"...Amazing\nIt's the first time I've seen a flying dragon egg."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_2_2,"I wonder what kind of person is inside the egg\nI hope to meet you soon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_3_1,"Having a dragon from an egg means\nthe born flying dragon is\na baby, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_3_2,"We are your parents.\nCan I take care of you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_1,"Did that white dragon give us the flying dragon egg\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_2,"Since you said it was good,\nI mistakenly thought you were going to give me some really nice junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_3,"Former Potsucon No. 2.\nDo you have any other gifts?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_5_1,"I never thought the dragon king would bring us\ndragon eggs..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_5_2,"I didn't like his bossy attitude, but\nMaybe he was a surprisingly nice guy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_6_1,"If the egg is that big,\nwill the newly born flying dragon be able to carry all of us\nand fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_1_1,"Warm up the egg with the dragon flame stone and have the dragon show its face to you as soon as possible.　"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_1_2,"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of girl she is!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_2_1,"It's a tough job to be a Dragon Guardian,\nto have to live in such a rugged and inhospitable land."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_3_1,"Dragon Flame Stone sounds like a very hot name.\nI wonder if the egg will be boiled..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_4_1,"A warm stone that can hatch eggs...\nI don't even want to use it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_1,"I wonder how hot it is inside the egg heated by the dragon flame stone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_2,"It's enough to hatch an egg.\nIsn't it a good temperature for a flying dragon?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_3,"It's so hot that the Hiryu\nmight jump out."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_6_1,"Now that you have collected the dragon flame stones, all you have to do is go back to Mr. Wandora's house and hatch the dragon egg."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_1_1,"Even though it just hatched from an egg,\nthat flying dragon is doing really well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_1_2,"If you can fly that high in the sky,\nI think you can reach the island of Ethene\nin no time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_2_1,"It looks like Hiryuu is enjoying\nthe outside world for the first time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_3_1,"The adult wyvern was scary, but\nthis newborn baby is\nso cute!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_4_1,"I hate such useful creatures that can\ncarry people and fly right after birth!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_4_2,"Even when Chiri was a baby, she was useless,\ncrying all the time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_5_1,"It felt so good\nto fly in the sky...\nI'm a little jealous."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_6_1,"It looks like you're\nattached to that boy {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_6_2,"Come on.\nLet me call you by blowing the flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_1_r7000,"It's a little unstable, but...\nThe ride quality of the Hiryu is surprisingly not bad."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_1,"I was worried at first, but\nHiryu seems to trust us completely."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_2,"Let's go show\nthat guy to Sage Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_2_1_r7000,"This is my first time flying this high in the sky."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_2_1,"That wyvern guy... he's so smart\nHe seems to understand what we're saying.\nHe's reliable!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_1_r7000,"The height and ride comfort are different from Kamushika...!\nThis may be the first time\nI've looked down on the ground from such a high place...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_1,"I like the wind I feel at the height of the dragon because it feels good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_2_r7000,"If you look down that far,\nyou'll fall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_2,"Fuura, that looked like fun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_4_1_r7000,"Get me off here!\nIt's Kanben who rides a useful creature!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_4_1,"It was terrible to be carried by a useful flying dragon, but I could see a scene in the distance that looked like there was\njunk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_5_1_r7000,"It's this high...I'm worried about falling\n, but it's kind of fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_5_1,"I'm sure Lushenda will\nwelcome the flying dragon, so\nlet's go to Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_1_r7000,"I haven't told anyone yet, but\nIt's me. My dream was to fly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_1,"Now that you can fly through the sky on a flying dragon,\nlet's go back to report to Lady Lushenda.\n...Now you can finally meet Pegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_2_r7000,"Ever since I saw the picture of the hero riding Pegasus in a picture book read to me when I was little, I've always admired you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_3_r7000,"I never thought I would be able to fly through the skies on a flying dragon before Pegasus!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_4_r7000,"All that's left is to find Pegasus and fly side by side with him.It'll be even better!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_5_1,"If we don't find Pegasus, it seems unlikely that we will be able to\nbreak the barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_5_2,"Even Lady Lushenda seems to be doubting the existence of Pegasus, so it looks like it will take a long time to find it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_1,"...Hey, {pc} is worried about whether Pegasus will actually be found\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_2,"I strongly...strongly believe that Pegasus will\nappear before us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_3,"Because the ally mentioned in the legend\nhas really appeared and is still\nby my side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_4,"If Pegasus, your allies, and your\nfriends lend you their power,\neven the Great Demon King will not be your enemy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_5,"There must have been some progress in the investigation.\nLet's listen to Lady Lushenda's story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_1_1,"If we don't return the turtle to Pegasus,\nwe can't go to the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_1_2,"First of all, let's look for the\nTense flower that Mr. Crows mentioned.\nThere should be a clue to it on the island of Ethene."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_2_1,"In order to bring Pegasus back after it turned into a turtle,\nthat Tenth Flower is needed, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_2_2,"This is getting a bit complicated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_3_1,"The turtle was a Pegasus...\nUnless Mr. Crows explains it to you,\nyou'll never know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_4_1,"I like the current turtle even though it seems useless!\nIs it no good as it is now!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_1_1,"...It's not {pc}'s fault, but\n{pc}'s brother is involved.\nI guess we'll have no choice but to resolve it ourselves."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_1_2,"When I heard Mr. Issho's story,\nyou are amazing brothers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_2_1,"I thought\ncame here to look for the Tenth Flower...\nIs this {pc}'s brother's butt wipe...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_2_2,"Issho's old man, you're all right, aren't you?\nWell, I guess I'll have no choice but to bring you some rainbow-colored pyroxene\nas a nuisance fee."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_3_1,"It's wrong for {pc} to get\nangry instead of {pc}'s brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_3_2,"Issho doesn't seem to be willing to listen to me, though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_4_1,"It's great to meet\nthe brother of former Potsucon No. 2! I wonder what kind of\nwonderful trouble he's going to cause me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_5_1,"Mr. Isshou is\nunderstandable to be angry, but Mr. {pc} is paying\nan inconvenience fee..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_5_2,"I wish there was some other way, but\nfor now, it might be better to find the stone and give it to you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_1,"I guess you have a brother after all.\nI kind of understand that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_2,"Yes...When I talk to you,\nI can't put it into words clearly, but\nI get the feeling that I have a brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_3,"Also, as Isshou said,\nI'm not the kind of person who would repay a favor in an additional way."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_4,"I would like you to tell me what your brother is like someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_1_1,"Rainbow-colored pyroxene...\nIt's a beautiful stone that doesn't look like\nshould be treated as a nuisance fee."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_2_1,"If you bring the rainbow-colored pyroxene,\nIsshou's old man will be satisfied."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_3_1,"If I give you the rainbow-colored pyroxene,\nIssho will probably forgive you, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_4_1,"Is this stone a substitute for a trouble fee?\nI don't hate the word 'nuisance', but\nI'm not interested in a sparkling stone like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_5_1,"They're asking for a precious stone as a nuisance fee, so\nI shouldn't keep you waiting.\nLet's go back to Mr. Isshou's house."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_6_1,"I got the trouble money for Mr. Issho.\nNow, can you tell me something\nabout {pc}'s brother?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_1_1,"As a father, Mr. Isshou also\ntried to protect his daughters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_2_1,"Issho's old man is worried that his daughter and {pc}'s brother were being chased by\nsome dangerous guys."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_2_2,"I feel like I can\nunderstand your desire to test us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_3_1,"Mr. Isshou is very kind and\nfamily-oriented..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_4_1,"I was angry and asked him to pay me for the inconvenience, but he started saying that he wasn't really angry.\nI don't understand him. He's an old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_5_1,"My daughters were being chased by dangerous debt collectors.\nIt's no wonder they suspected us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_5_2,"Mr. Issho seems to know\nthe whereabouts of Mr. {pc}'s brother, so\nlet's listen to him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_6_1,"Even though it's about {pc}'s brother\n60 years ago, it seems confusing,\nLet's hear the story in more detail."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_1_1,"You never know when a person's life will end\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_1_2,"I understand very well\nIssho's desire to see his family after he left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_2_1,"For the sake of Isshou's old man,\nsomehow find\n{pc}'s brothers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_2_2,"This happened 60 years ago...\nIt seems like a difficult story..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! Let's let\nMr. Issho meet your daughters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_3_2,"I'm sad that I won't be able to see my family\nfor a long time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_4_1,"Chiri has become a great person, but if I never see you again, will I regret\nwhen I die?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_4_2,"You will definitely regret it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_5_1,"It's heartbreaking that I won't be able to see my family until I die.I feel for my family.\nI want to fulfill Mr. Isshou's request."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_5_2,"I will interview Mr. Issho\nin the Kingdom of Gran Zedora so that he will not regret it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_6_1,"Sixty years ago,\nMr. Flasco lived in Gran Zedora Castle Town...\nFirst, let's ask him about that person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_6_2,"It's okay.\nI'm sure someone knows something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_1_1,"It was unfortunate that Mr. Flask, who was my reliable friend, had passed away, but\nI was able to hear some useful information from Mr. Salmar."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_1_2,"It would be nice if Daira remembered\nthe past..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_2_1,"I thought {pc}'s brothers and Lilior were\nbastards for sure, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_2_2,"Maybe he's a nice guy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_3_1,"Mr. Flask, you've passed away.\nMr. Issho, you must be sad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_4_1,"Was your brother an excellent guy who also helped others?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_4_2,"You're betraying my expectations by making me think you're a piece of crap.\nYou look exactly like someone!\nHey, are you the former Potsucon No. 2?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_5_1,"Mr. Flask had passed away, but\nhis grandson, Mr. Salmer, knew\nthe story of that time, which was helpful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_6_1,"It was 60 years ago after all...\nI might be lucky if there were other people\nwho seemed to remember what happened back then."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_1_1,"...No matter what happens, the bond between parent and child will never be broken..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_1_2,"I'm sure my father is also\nworried about me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_2_1,"Isshou's old man must have been keeping\nsomething."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_2_2,"I just hope\nthat Mr. Isshou hasn't thrown it away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_3_1,"Mr. Issho, it's been a long time since I last heard\nyour daughter's story.I'm glad to hear from you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_4_1,"He was a bad guy when he thanked us, but\nhe left his precious letter alone.\nThat old man loved it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_5_1,"Isshou seems relieved to know about Lilior's current situation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_6_1,"Until I find what I'm looking for,\nIssho, let's take your word for it and take a walk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_6_2,"I would like you to tell me about the island of Ethene where you lived...."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_1_1,"I can't believe you have\nthe power to save many people...\nBrothers look alike."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_1_2,"You're a wonderful brother that I respect!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_2_1,"I never knew that {pc}'s brother was an alchemist."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_2_2,"You alchemized drugs and you got melazo fever.\nYou saved a lot of people, right?\nAren't you big guys?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_1,"Dairah also knew\nthe man in the suspicious sunglasses."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_2,"It seems like\nthey were persistently chasing Lilior and the others across the ocean, so I wonder if those two are still safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_3,"I feel like I'm still doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_4_1,"The brother of the former Potsucon 2 was\nthe kind of person who could help someone in trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_4_2,"You'll like it even more than the\nimpression you got when you heard it from the old man who paid the nuisance fee!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_5_1,"Could {pc}'s brother and Lilior be able to alchemize\ndrugs because\nthey were researching plants...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_1,"Perhaps because we were being chased by a suspicious man,\nwe had a hard time reaching {pc}'s brother and Lilior's location."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_2,"But I feel like I'll get there soon.\nMy ring is very accurate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_3,"Don't rush, let's look for\nbased on the information we have so far."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_1_1,"The rainbow-colored pyroxene was originally used for\nLilior's pendant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_1_2,"I'm glad that Mr. Issho and his son were able to\nbond once again across time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_2_1,"The key to the Tenth Flower is\nIsshou's old man holds the\nkey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_2_2,"Let's go get\nthat key quickly so that the old man doesn't forget it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_1,"I'm glad Lilior liked the rainbow-colored pyroxene pendant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_2,"I'm sure Mr. Issho would be happy too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_3,"I'm starting to want to\nmeet my father too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_4_1,"You remembered the gift for your daughter, but you forgot about the important letter."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_4_2,"The old man named Isshou was actually a bit of an idiot...\nThat's really good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_5_1,"What did {pc}'s brother entrust to\nIssho?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_5_2,"If it leads you\nto the Tenth Flower, you should\nhurry up and accept it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_6_1,"Isshou and Lilior\n, I'm glad we were able to reconnect\nwith our bond."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_6_2,"Let's report to Mr. Issho and ask\nabout the key to the flower that was sent to him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_1_1,"I have never heard of\nthe Pearl of the Wind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_2_1,"What is that pig?\nI told you to go find the pearl of the wind\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_3_1,"I can't imagine what a pearl of the wind is...\nWill the wind blow if I touch it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_4_1,"What that pig needs is\nThe Pearl of the Wind seems to be valuable!\nI want you to search for something more worthless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_5_1,"Mr. Issho said that the letter he entrusted to you contained something like\na pearl..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_5_2,"You may have found the letter by now, so why not check it out?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_6_1,"There are pigs that can talk!\nIf possible, I'd like to help you find what you're looking for..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_1_1,"Give Hana the\nPearl of the Wind given to you by {pc}'s brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_1_2,"Maybe she knows something\nabout Tensu flowers."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_2_1,"The pearl of the wind in the letter\nis the one who said earlier that the pig was looking for it\n, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_3_1,"Hana asked you to bring\nthe Pearl of the Wind, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_3_2,"It might be something important, so let's give it to Hana quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_4_1,"I don't think I can understand\nthat pig who wants such a valuable pearl!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_5_1,"The pearl of the wind that was in the letter is the item that\nHana wanted..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_5_2,"I'm also interested in the boy Mr. Issho mentioned\n, so I think it would be best to give him\nto Mr. Hana right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_6_1,"The key to the Tenth Flower is the pearl of the wind that the pig was looking for...?\nWhat does it mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_1_1,"Let's wait in front of the rock door in Lazea's Wind Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_1_2,"I feel like I can finally meet\nthe Tensu flower..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_2_1,"Hana will guide you\nto where the Tensu flower is."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_2_2,"You're a solid pig."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_3_1,"It's finally time to return the turtle to Pegasus\nYou can see the Tenth flower!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_4_1,"Is it the Wind Cave of Lazea?\nIt sounds like there might be some good junk in there\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_5_1,"If the flower in Hana's words is\nthe Tenth flower...\nLet's hurry to the rock door of Razea's wind cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_1,"I guess all you have to do is wait\nfor the pig to fly in the wind hole in Lazea."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_2,"...What?\nAre you flying away? A pig...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_3,"How does it fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_1_1,"{pc}'s brother\npaved the way for the Tenth Flower with his own hands..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_2_1,"For the sake of\n{pc}'s brother who alchemized the Tenth Flower,\nthe Great Demon King must be defeated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_3_1,"{pc}'s brother\nhas worked hard\nfor {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_3_2,"I'm jealous of you\nfor having such a kind brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_4_1,"I was looking for what kind of junk\nmy brother, the former Potsucon No. 2, has, but it seems like he doesn't have anything good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_5_1,"A shining tenth flower that I spent my life alchemizing.\nWe cannot let the fruit of that effort go to waste."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_6_1,"Even though {pc}'s brothers are apart,\nthey have always been thinking about you.\nThe brightness of the tenth flower seems to represent that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_6_2,"In order to respond to those feelings,\nlet us fulfill our mission!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_5_1,"To return the turtle to Pegasus\nFind the lost Tenth flower..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_5_2,"Mr. Crows' words are very mysterious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_6_1,"The guardian deity of your hometown, the Turtle, was the current form of\nPegasus..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_6_2,"It must be fate to have a connection with\nyou, the hero's ally, in a place like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_1_1,"With Hana's guidance, I was able to obtain\nthe Shining Tenth Flower."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_1_2,"The only thing left to do is to\nreturn the turtle to his original Pegasus form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_2_1,"Hana's guy...\nHe finally finished his job\nHe looked relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_2_2,"I've been waiting\nfor a long time for {pc} to come.\nLet's let him get some rest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_3_1,"I hope Hana can spend some time relaxing\nfrom now on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_4_1,"I'm not interested in a\npig who has completed his task to the end!\nI can take a nap and take it easy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_4_2,"Are you trying to\ntake care of Hana in your own way, Duston?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_5_1,"To be able to create a creature like Hana..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_5_2,"Your\nbrother {pc}'s skill as an alchemist was very good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_6_1,"The time has finally come for the turtle to regain his\nPegasus form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_6_2,"It's almost time to borrow the power of Pegasus and break through\nthe\nbarrier of Great Demon King Madesagora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_10_2_1,"Is this the Windy City of Azlan?\nIt's certainly very windy."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_10_4_1,"It's a small town, isn't it?\nI don't think there's much to be expected from\nsuch junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_1_1,"Is this Fuura's hometown?\nThe wind feels nice."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_1_2_1,"Wow, the wind is strong.\nIt's a pretty pleasant town, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_1_4_1,"It's a small town, isn't it?\nI don't think we'd expect to find a lot of junk there..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_2_2_1,"The wind is still blowing in this town."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_2_4_1,"I wonder what the monster is doing these days...I want to talk to him once and for all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_3_1,"Yeah! The wind isn't stagnant!\nLooks like it'll be okay even if we don't go back yet!"

PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_2_1,"...You have to do it, Fuura.\nBut this journey will be dangerous, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_2_2,"...I'm still a little scared, but it's okay!\nI want to protect this town and the world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_3_1,"Thank you for your continued support!\nI will do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_4_1,"Once this is all over,\nI would like to talk with Kaiju carefully about\nShumi."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_1_1,"It's a beautiful town...\nIt's so different from our Ogre town."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_2_1,"...This is the royal capital of Kamiharumui.\nIsn't it a peaceful place?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_3_1,"This is the royal capital, Kamiharmui!\nIt's bigger than Azran."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_4_1,"This is a building that you don't see very often in other countries.\nThis is a strange piece of junk.\nI'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_5_1,"Looking at the flowers planted in the capital\nmakes my heart feel soothed."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_1_1,"It's a beautiful town...\nIt's so different from\nour Ogre town."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_1,"A lot of things happened, but\nI was able to regain the power of Eltona's sacred place, so\nit was really good."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_5_1,"Flowers are dancing in this town too, and it reminds me of\nMegistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_1_1,"I'm really glad I was able to protect this beautiful town."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_1,"...King Nikoloi also looked refreshed, as if he had gotten rid of his troubles."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_2_1,"...I feel like the\nflowers are kinder than the last time I came."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_3_1,"Someday, I want Azlan to become a splendid town that rivals the royal capital."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_4_1,"I want to go to that abandoned castle again to admire the junk and the others."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_5_1,"I want to protect the country like King Nikoloi."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_3_1,"...Kyusuke!\nYou're doing great as always!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_4_1,"There were no ghosts after all, right?\nToo bad!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_5_1,"King Nikoloi supported this country even after all that happened.\nI want to become strong like King Nikoloi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_1_1,"A royal curse?\nIt would be unwise of the king to go to such a terrifying place."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_2_1,"...Hmm. An abandoned castle, huh?\nThat seems like a good idea."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_3_1,"Is that Kyusuke from earlier?\nJust when I thought I had finally graduated from the Garden of Learning,\nhe was working here..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_4_1,"Hoohoo! It's an abandoned castle!\nThis guy has high expectations!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_5_1,"An incident in which members of the royal family died in a disturbing manner...\nA sacred place that lost its power..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_5_2,"Why is Mr. Nikolai\ngoing to such a dangerous place 50 years later?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_1_1,"Those kids...\nI didn't think they were evil, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_2_1,"...What was that just now? A ghost?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_3_1,"......"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_3_2,"Oi, Fuura! You look pale! Are you alright!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_4_1,"That's great!\nEven just an abandoned castle is tempting\nA ghost that is useless just by looking at it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_5_1,"...What on earth is that now?\nIt was more like a ghost...\nthan a vision..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_1_1,"...King Nikoloi is also worried.\nLet's go back to Kamihalmy Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_2_1,"...Did what just happened here?\nIt was certainly outrageous, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_1,"Isn't that a gh-ghost!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_2,"...That feels like a phantom.\nIt doesn't seem like a ghost."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_3,"Well...that's fine, but...\nThere's something\nyou want to tell me, right? What is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_4_1,"Hmm, it's useless...\nI don't think so.\nI don't like ghosts like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_5_1,"This is...\nIs it a scene from the past, like the one I saw at my mother's villa...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_1_1,"Leaves of the Great Black Tree of the Cursed Earth...\nDid you really want something like that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_2_1,"...A cursed land.\nWhat kind of place is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_1,"It's nice to be able to help King Nikoloi, but\nI wonder if I'll be with Kyusuke..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_2,"You act like you've known me for a while, but\nAre you an acquaintance?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_3,"We were studying together in the Garden of Learning, and they were selling us useless junk like\na magic drug that lets you memorize entire dictionaries."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_4,"...I think that's terrible, but how do you know it doesn't work?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_4_1,"That Kyusuke is my husband...\nIt smells the same as Potsucon.\nI don't think he does...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_5_1,"I don't think that the apparition is meaningless.\nI think it's trying to tell you something, like it was with me."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_1_1,"The roots of that big tree are\ngrowing everywhere.\nLet's proceed using this as a landmark."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_2_1,"Hey, hey, he's not coming.\nWell, it's better than having more trouble..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_3_1,"I'm glad Kyusuke isn't coming with me, but\nThat makes me kind of angry.\nYou idiot!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_4_1,"It's rumored that plants and trees can't grow properly on this\ncursed earth! There might be some wonderful\njunk sleeping in places like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_5_1,"Everyone, please be careful.\nThis land is contaminated with demonic miasma.\nThere are poisonous swamps everywhere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_1_1,"Those leaves...\nIt looked like they were waiting for {pc} to come."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_2_1,"...I never thought there would be a guard in a place like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_3_1,"Those guards...\nThey look a lot like the spirits of the World Tree that I heard about in the Garden of Learning\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_4_1,"It looks like a dead leaf and looks like it can't be used\nIt's a leaf!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_5_1,"The last remaining piece fell\nas if being sucked into it by\n{pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_5_2,"Does that mean that you were recognized because you defeated those guards?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_1_1,"That leaf...was it really a good idea to give it to King Nikoloi\n?\nI have a bad feeling about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_2_1,"Are you heading to that ruined castle again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_3_1,"Eh! Are you going with Kyusuke!?\n...No way."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_3_2,"We studied at the same school, right?\nOh, trust me."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_4_1,"Gufufufu. Are you going to the abandoned castle again?\nI'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_5_1,"Now that we have\ntaken the leaves of the Great Dark Tree, I believe we have a responsibility\nto see it through to the end."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_1_1,"There are so many illusions..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_2_1,"...What's going on?\nAppearances are appearing one after another.\nIs it because of the leaves of the Great Dark Tree?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_3_1,"If that vision really happened,\nthe queen should have recovered, but\nI wonder what happened...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_4_1,"As expected, this castle is full of\nwonderful junk... Gufufufu!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_5_1,"This is an illusion from the past after all...?\nWhat is the meaning behind the leaves of the Great Dark Tree?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_1_1,"So the queen was sealed away?\nKing Nikoloi's older sister?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_2_1,"I never expected that\nQueen Sama, who was thought to be dead, was put to sleep."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_3_1,"You mean that the Queen showed a vision to\nKing Nikoloi in order to protect the sacred place?\nThe members of the royal family are amazing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_4_1,"Do you still have something to do!?\nIs it okay if I just admire the junk around here?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_5_1,"...Is this the reason we brought\nthe leaves of the Great Dark Tree...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_1_1,"We are responsible for delivering the leaves of the Great Dark Tree\n, so I'm glad we were able to resolve it safely."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_2_1,"...I feel like Kyusuke, the old man\ntook advantage of me, but\nI guess it's good that he was able to protect King Nikoloi as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_3_1,"Wow! Kyusuke once again has a good point!\nHe's really in a good mood!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_4_1,"When I'm at that sacred place,\nI feel a tingle down my back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_4_2,"I'm feeling nervous at the sacred place...\nMr. Duston, it's not a monster, is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_5_1,"Princess Rita...you followed\nthe same path as my father..."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_10_3_1,"Wow, the ocean is so close!\nThe smell of the wind is completely different from the forest!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_10_4_1,"Is it the sea?\nI don't feel at ease when I'm covered in water like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_2_1,"…….\nNo, it's nothing."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_3_1,"Sawmya and the kitten are safe, the town is saved, and we even got a key emblem.\nIt's a happy day!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_4_1,"It's okay to be thanked by the people of the town.\nI've often faced embarrassing situations like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_2_1,"Look, I told you that parting is something that's easy to do, right?\nLet's just go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_3_1,"Mr. Huza...\nI'm a little surprised that you would\nsay something like that to Somya."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_3_2,"Noise.\nI'll leave it behind."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_4_1,"Next time, somewhere with more junk\nThat's good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_1_1,"It's a pretty nice town with a great view and a beautiful beach."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_1_3_1,"Wow! The sea is nearby!\nThe smell of the wind is completely different from the forest!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_1_4_1,"I'm not good at the sea, though."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_2_1,"I wonder how Somya is doing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_2_3_1,"Sawmya, how are you doing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_2_4_1,"Thank you is no good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_5_1,"Is it the Ripple Tuning Fork from the Wedi Ruins...?\nI would love to see it."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_3_1,"What is Wendy's most important thing?\nI'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_4_1,"Ruins! What a sweet surprise!!\nLooks like there's some nice junk lying around!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_4_2,"Hey, are you also interested in\nold things?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_4_3,"I don't care how old it is.\nBut do you want to ride a boat?\nI'm not good on water!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_24_3_1,"Is Somya okay?\nI'm a little worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_24_4_1,"A kitten just meows.\nIt's useless.\nI kind of like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_3_1,"That man... is\nsomething important to Wendy, right?\nI wonder if he can fix something that big."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_4_1,"Are you going to fix that?\nIt's turned into a nice piece of junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_4_2,"No, no,\nIf we don't fix it, we'll be in trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_4_3,"Then, while I'm touring the ruins, I'll look for\nother junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_30_3_1,"It was beautiful to see the sea being given holy protection\nby the power of songs of grace!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_30_4_1,"In the end, there wasn't anything special.\nSince it's called ruins, I was hoping for some excellent junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_40_3_1,"Sawmya...isn't she the girl from earlier?\nWhat's going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_40_4_1,"Cat... Hey cat...\nI hope it's useless when it's a kitten."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_50_3_1,"I'm going to throw the kitten into the sea!\nI feel sorry for him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_50_4_1,"Just meowing like that is useless.\nBringing a kitten home...\nThere's a lot to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_60_2_1,"Oh my god, it's a kid's weight."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_60_3_1,"Somya...? Let's do our best together!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_60_4_1,"Cats don't really collect\nthings...\nWell, I'll go without high expectations."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_70_2_1,"He knows the loneliness of not having a parent\nthe best.\nSomya will understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_70_3_1,"I don't understand how Somya feels...\nBut...I'm sure you'll get through it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_70_4_1,"There was nothing special about the junk!\nShumi is in trouble with cats!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_1_1,"It's a town with great views and plenty of water.\nIt's very different from Rangao Village where I lived."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_2_1,"Is this the town where the queen who sings songs of blessings is?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_2_2,"I need to become well known in this town someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_3_1,"Wow!\nIt's a very beautiful country, with waterways running throughout the town."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_4_1,"It's a restless town with water everywhere\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_4_2,"...No, no, this is the kind of town\nThere might be some junk I haven't seen yet.\nFormer Potsucon No. 2! Let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_5_1,"Queen Diore, who rules this country, is said to be respected by her subjects as a\ngreat prince.\nI must follow her example..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_1_1,"I wonder what kind of powerful monster\nwas sealed in this land?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_1,"I wonder if that monster had something to do with the Demon King?\nI defeated it, so it doesn't matter either way."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_5_1,"Queen Diore, who rules this country, is said to be respected by her subjects as a\ngreat monarch.\nI must follow her example..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_1_1,"Have you adjusted\nto this era, Celia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_1,"...Prince Odis has started to look quite\nnice."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_2_1,"...Someday, I will\naccomplish something big by myself and\nmake a name for myself!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_3_1,"Are the prince and the sealed shrine maiden\ndoing well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_4_1,"I don't like that queen!\nThere's quite\nsomething to see about the prince, though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_5_1,"Are Queen Diore and Prince Odis getting along well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_3_1,"I'm really glad that the queen and prince\nwere able to reconcile.\nI hope you continue to cherish your mother."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_4_1,"Although he's not as good as that young lady,\nthe prince of this country is quite a pompous one too.\nI kind of like him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_5_1,"Don't give in to fake fortune-telling\nI have to work harder too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_1_1,"It's a beautiful song...\nPeople who can sing such songs are as cold as ice.\nI don't think that's the case..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_2_1,"I heard some rumors, but\nIs this the song of raw blessings?\nWhen you listen to it up close, it's amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_3_1,"Uh... wow.......\nWonderful...."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_3_2,"...I'm so glad there was no\nsong in the Kazefuri ceremony...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_4_1,"The young lady who was being chased by a dog earlier...\nI feel like there's a prank!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_4_2,"Mr. Duston is more interested in\nthan the Queen's song..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_5_1,"Lord Diore is giving\nholy protection to the water all over the country.\nIt's amazing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_1_1,"Is there something surprising...?\nYou went out of your way to hide it in the labyrinth, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_2_1,"...Is he the prince of our country?\nI like the fact that he doesn't seem to be overbearing just because he's a prince, but I also feel like he's unreliable."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_3_1,"You must be an amazing fortune teller to predict our arrival!\nI wonder if that person also heard voices from somewhere?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_4_1,"The fortune teller from earlier was being chased by a dog.\nIsn't she a young lady who seems to have good prospects?\nWas I wrong in my prediction?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_5_1,"I don't think it's someone else's business.\nI want to be the prince's strength."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_1_1,"I'm not bad at helping people, but...\nThat fortune teller...something's bothering me."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_2_1,"I was surprised….\nThat girl is still alive…."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_3_1,"I feel sorry for\nbeing involved in some kind of incident and being locked up for\nall this time..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_4_1,"Hmm, those underground ruins...\nLooks like there's still something going on in my area.\nThere's definitely some junk I haven't seen yet!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_5_1,"...A person like your father who\nsacrificed himself\nfor his country in the past...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_1_1,"I wonder if the Queen knows about her daughter who was trapped in the labyrinth earlier...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_2_1,"The rumor that the Queen and Prince are not on good terms...\nLooks like it's true."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_3_1,"I wonder if the queen and the prince don't get along...?\nSince your mother is doing well,\nI hope they get along well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_4_1,"I wanted to ask you if you\ncould give me some junk from the castle, but it seems like\nthere are no islands to attach to."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_5_1,"I don't get listened to even if I express my opinion...\nPrince Odis' feelings...\nI feel like I understand a little bit too."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_1_1,"{pc} made the decision, so\nI'll go with you, but shouldn't I\ntalk to your mother a little more?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_1_2,"……."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_2_1,"...I'm going to make him a prince.\nHe's got a lot of nerve, isn't he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_2_2,"I'm sorry for being selfish.\nBut I'm not a child anymore.\nI can't just do my mother's bidding forever."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_3_1,"I'm rooting for you, Odis.\nGood luck!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_3_2,"Thank you.\nI am truly grateful to you all."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_4_1,"This is a tropical ruin, I've never seen it before\nLooks like I'm expecting some junk!\nKupupupupu!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_5_1,"Can I really explore\nthe ruins that I will enter when I inherit the throne?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_1_1,"There's even a guard there.\nAs expected, it's a ruin connected to the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_2_1,"...Hmm. It's not our enemy, but\nit seems like it's a very important ruin to have even a guardian."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_3_1,"Prince Odis\nDid you learn the song now?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_4_1,"There's junk lying around all over the place.\nIt's a very nice ruin!\nIt's a shame that it's too heavy to take home!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_5_1,"It seems that Prince Odis has been safely recognized as a member of the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_1_1,"{pc}, let's go!\nWe have no choice but to stop\nthe monster that was sealed away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_2_1,"...Hey, hey.\nIsn't it crazy that the seal is broken and the monsters wake up?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_3_1,"Wow!\nMr. {pc}, what should we do!?\nThe sealed monster is about to wake up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_4_1,"That young lady has a wonderful dick!\nAfter all, she wasn't crazy in my eyes!\nI would definitely like to have her as my assistant."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_5_1,"Diore may seem strict at first glance, but...\nShe is my mother after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_1_1,"That fake fortune teller...\nI hope he doesn't do any harm again."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_2_1,"...As expected from being called a tyrant,\nhe was a powerful monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_3_1,"The Queen and the Sealed Priestess\nwere amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_4_1,"Ah, ah….\nThat clunky young lady has gone.\nI was thinking of scouting her, but…."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_5_1,"I was nervous when the\nseal of the monster that could destroy the world was broken, but thanks to everyone\nI was able to defeat it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_5_2,"Was I able to be of some help?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_2_1,"The whole town feels tingly."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_3_1,"There's something a little scary about this town...\nEveryone is big, but\nIt's not just that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_4_1,"Mountains and rocks!\nI love these bare landscapes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_1,"I'm glad we didn't have to waste blood between the ogres.\nThank you so much."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_2_1,"...A while ago\na war was about to break out?\nThere are a lot of people who look strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_3_1,"The ogres are big and a bit scary, but\n...they seem sincere."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_4_1,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\nCould you please ask the king to\nshow me the junk in the castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_1,"Even though various things happened,\nKing Bagdo was safely recovered\nAs expected of a wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_2_1,"This country has calmed down completely."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_3_1,"The people of Glen are returning to their daily lives as if nothing had happened.\nIt was really good..."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_4_1,"That magical miasma stone necklace\nis said to cause harm if you wear it\nIt's so stupid!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_4_2,"If you don't want it,\nI would have liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_3_1,"King Bugdo...he's healed properly!\nI'm really glad that the people of Guren didn't have to feel so sad."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_4_1,"Moki!! The king is thanking me.\nIt's so embarrassing!\nI'll go somewhere else as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_5_1,"King Bagdo is a gentle and honest king who\nhas a high reputation among the people, and\nI respect him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_5_2,"To try to manipulate King Bagdo into\nwar...\nI can't forgive him."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_2_1,"Hey, hey...\nI thought you were suddenly thrown into prison.\nYou should help save the country, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_3_1,"If a war breaks out, everyone will be sad.\n{pc}, let's do something!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_4_1,"The prison was dark, damp, and smelled like mold...\nIt felt like they were telling me that you were a helpless piece of crap. It was great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_2_1,"The reason why the king of this country went crazy is because of that bastard named Nergel...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_3_1,"The Demon King... Hades... It's so scary... But!\nI decided to protect you!\nMr. {pc}! I'll do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_4_1,"Why go out of your way to\nlook for something useful!\nIt's a good thing to lose a broken bone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_2_1,"Sage Sama, I don't know what happened between you and that\nmonster, Oren, but\nshould I really take that Holy Grail?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_2_2,"...\nIt's fine for now. Don't worry about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_3_1,"Eidos\nYou look kind of sad."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_4_1,"Holy Grail? Something like that that seems useful is\nnot my thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_2_1,"...A dragon this time?\nReally,\nI never get bored when I'm with {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_3_1,"The terrifying dragon... is scary, but\nWe have to heal King Bagdo quickly!\nLet's do our best, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_4_1,"Are you going to go get something useful again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_2_1,"...He was quite a challenging opponent.\nIt was a good experience."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_3_1,"Wow, {pc}! That's amazing!\nWe defeated the dragon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_4_1,"I was hoping for\nsome of the water dragon's treasured junk, but\nthere wasn't any nice junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_2_1,"That wise old man left of his own accord, but\nAre you sure you can't heal the king with this?\nIf we fail, there'll be a war, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_3_1,"We must quickly restore King Bagdo and stop the\nwar."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_4_1,"If we get King Sama back, I wonder if you could show me some of the junk in the castle."
