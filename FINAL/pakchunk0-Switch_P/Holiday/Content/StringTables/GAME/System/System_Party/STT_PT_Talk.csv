PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_4_1,"Looks good! \n In a town like this, \n there's bound to be some junk to find!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_3_1,"This is Orphea's town!\nIt looks like a really fun town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_20_2_1,"{pc}!\n You don't want to leave us alone like this, do you? \n Let's go ask the circus guys."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_20_4_1,"What a stupid trick that has no punch line!\n I have sympathy for the leader!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_20_3_1,"The children disappeared, but it's a miracle, right?\n It's okay, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_2_1,"For whatever reason or not, \n I don't like kidnapping kids."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_4_1,"That prank call…\n That’s pretty good!\n I have a feeling we’ll have a new comrade!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_3_1,"It's a big deal, but \n Everyone seems to believe in the leader. \n I wonder if there's something wrong...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_2_1,"We don't have any other clues, so let's go to a place called Silver Hill."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_4_1,"If you say something like that to me, \n I don't know what kind of horse bones there are, but... \n I'm going to go crazy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_3_1,"Why did the leader, who is also the town mayor, kidnap \n the children...?\n Let's go to Silver Hill!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_2_1,"What are you trying to say \n What do you mean? That leader?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_4_1,"That door's incomprehensible appearance\n is a bit intriguing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_3_1,"That leader...\n There seems to be something wrong with him after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_2_1,"So you kidnapped them and hid them in order to protect the children from that monster?\n Isn't the mayor quite hot?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_4_1,"It's starting to become a bit of a hassle..."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_3_1,"Captain-san seems like a nice person after all!\n Dear {pc}!\n Let's help Captain-san!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_2_1,"So that demon was the culprit? \n Now we just have to get the kids home. \n Let's go quickly {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_4_1,"That Zaigas is a devil\n He'll have to wait 15 years before he's defeated\n He was quite a dick."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_3_1,"Captain-san, you were a good person after all!\n I'm sure the children will be safe!\n Let's hurry and pick them up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_2_1,"Tch, wouldn't it have been better if that group leader or the mayor had told \n the reason from the beginning?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_4_1,"That door... If it was protecting the children, \n I wouldn't call it a flop. \n I'm disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_3_1,"I'm glad all the children are safe. \n We were able to defeat the scary devil, too. \n We're happy... I guess?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_2_1,"Hmph! \n The leader is so loopy until the end."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_4_1,"Key emblem again! \n Stop it! \n I’m not interested in it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_3_1,"Circus was fun!\n I even got a key emblem\n It was really great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_2_2_1,"The kids seem to be doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_2_1,"Wow, it's a \n lively place full of kids."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_2_4_1,"That door on Silver Hill...\n Can you take it home?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_4_1,"It's a lively place! \n In a town like this \n there's bound to be some junk to find!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_2_3_1,"This town is the same no matter when I come \n It looks like it's going to be a lot of fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_3_1,"This town has a similar atmosphere to \n Keki-chan. \n I think it's really cute!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_1,"I heard stories about it, but \n I'm glad the children in this town are safe."

PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_4_1,"Ruins! What a sweet surprise!!\n Looks like there's some nice junk lying around!"

PT_TALK_TXT_6_40_3_1,"Sawmya...isn't she the girl from earlier?\nWhat's going on?"

PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_2_1,"The whole town feels tingly."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_4_1,"Mountains and rocks! \n I love these bare landscapes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_3_1,"There's something a little scary about this town...\n Everyone is big, but \n It's not just that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_2_1,"Hey, hey...\n I thought you were suddenly thrown into prison.\n You should help save the country, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_4_1,"The prison was dark, damp, and smelled like mold... \n It felt like they were telling me that you were a helpless piece of crap. It was great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_3_1,"If a war breaks out, everyone will be sad. \n {pc}, let's do something!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_2_1,"The reason why the king of this country went crazy is because of that bastard named Nergel...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_4_1,"Why go out of your way to \n look for something useful!\n It's a good thing to lose a broken bone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_3_1,"The Demon King... Hades... It's so scary... But! \n I decided to protect you! \n Mr. {pc}! I'll do my best!"

PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_4_1,"Are you going to go get something useful again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_3_1,"The terrifying dragon... is scary, but \n We have to heal King Bagdo quickly! \n Let's do our best, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_2_1,"...He was quite a challenging opponent. \n It was a good experience."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_4_1,"I was hoping for \n some of the water dragon's treasured junk, but \n there wasn't any nice junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_3_1,"Wow, {pc}! That's amazing! \n We defeated the dragon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_2_1,"That wise old man left of his own accord, but \n Are you sure you can't heal the king with this? \n If we fail, there'll be a war, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_4_1,"If we get King Sama back, I wonder if you could show me some of the junk in the castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_3_1,"We must quickly restore King Bagdo and stop the \n war."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_1,"Even though various things happened,\nKing Bagdo was safely recovered\nAs expected of a wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_4_1,"Moki!! The king is thanking me.\n It’s so embarrassing!\n I’ll go somewhere else as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_3_1,"King Bugdo...he's healed properly!\n I'm really glad that the people of Guren didn't have to feel so sad.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_2_1,"This country has calmed down completely."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_2_1,"...A while ago \n a war was about to break out? \n There are a lot of people who look strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_4_1,"That magical miasma stone necklace\n is said to cause harm if you wear it\n It's so stupid!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_4_2,"If you don't want it, \n I would have liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_4_1,"Former Potsucon No. 2! \n Could you please ask the king to \n show me the junk in the castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_3_1,"The people of Glen are returning to their daily lives as if nothing had happened. \n It was really good..."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_3_1,"The ogres are big and a bit scary, but\n...they seem sincere."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_1,"I'm glad we didn't have to waste blood between the ogres. \n Thank you so much."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_5_1,"King Bagdo is a gentle and honest king who \n has a high reputation among the people, and \n I respect him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_5_2,"To try to manipulate King Bagdo into \n war...\n I can't forgive him."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_10_2_1,"Is this the Windy City of Azlan?\n It's certainly very windy."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_10_4_1,"It's a small town, isn't it? \n I don't think there's much to be expected from \n such junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_20_2_1,"Problems that seem troublesome, such as successors, are \n none of my business... \n {pc}. I'll leave them to you."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_20_4_1,"That young lady couldn't pass the exam\n She's quite a talent!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_30_2_1,"Fuura...\n Maybe he's lonely like Soumya\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_30_4_1,"That young lady hit eight points and dropped a doll. \n There's still hope!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_2_1,"Hmm. You're a kid again.\n...but I like your guts to do something about it yourself\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_4_1,"Oh my.\n I was thinking of giving you Potsucon No. 3, but \n I was so disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_45_2_1,"Hmm. Fuura guy\n Hey, it looks like you've gained more confidence."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_45_4_1,"That mountain checkpoint \n was small and seemed useless, but \n it was quite nice!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_2_1,"...I can't help it. Let me help you. \n Hey, Fuura! \n Don't leave my side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_2_2,"Yes!\n Ugh...this guy is kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_4_1,"Now, I wonder what \n will be in this tower? \n I'm looking forward to it!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_3_1,"I have to do it! \n I have to do it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_2_1,"That guy from Fuura has a lot of guts!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_2_2,"Uh...yeah!\n Thank you, Husa!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_4_1,"It's not my preference, but \n that monster seems to have his own \n style."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_3_1,"I did it...Mom..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_3_2,"Thank you...\n Kamshika and the others..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_2_1,"...You have to do it, Fuura.\n But this journey will be dangerous, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_2_2,"...I'm still a little scared, but it's okay!\n I want to protect this town and the world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_4_1,"Once this is all over, \n I would like to talk with Kaiju-san carefully about \n Shumi."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_3_1,"Thank you for your continued support!\n I will do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_2_2_1,"The wind is still blowing in this town \n."

PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_2_4_1,"I wonder what the monster is doing these days...I want to talk to him once and for all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_1_4_1,"It's a small town, isn't it? \n I don't think we'd expect to find a lot of junk there..."

PT_TALK_TXT_13_35_3_1,"What should we do?\n King Poopoppan, you won't listen to what we say\n at all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_35_1_1,"I need to somehow get the king to believe that \n that person named Id is the mastermind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_2_1,"...any wish will come true \n Is it a mysterious note?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_2_2,"Hyuza-san, do you have a wish that you would like to make come true?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_2_3,"I don't rely on notes like that. \n I'll use my own power to rise to the top."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_4_1,"Will I perish if I write my third wish?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_4_2,"If that's all it takes to get \n some nice junk, \n I'll be happy to write about it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_4_3,"If you give Mr. Duston the notebook, \n it looks like he's going to write on it, so \n you should never give it to him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_3_1,"Queen Alwe\n Did you really write your third wish?\n What did you wish for even though you are the queen?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_3_2,"I don't know about that either... \n But if you go to the villa, there might be \n a clue left behind. Let's hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_1_1,"Mr. Fosteil \n Isn't your prediction a voice that \n can be heard from anywhere?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_40_1_2,"...I see. \n You were guided by that voice... So..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_2_1,"...Hey, hey, Mr. Hero has entered the \n door?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_4_1,"If you don't need this door, \n can I take it home with you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_3_1,"The person from earlier was Queen Alwe? \n But Queen Alwe \n has passed away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_41_1_1,"...It's a mysterious door. \n But I don't find it unpleasant."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_2_1,"...What is that now? \n Did you see it in {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_4_1,"I don't know what you mean, but \n The notebook that makes wishes come true \n Looks like it's real!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_3_1,"Queen Arwe \n You looked so happy, so why did you write a third \n wish...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_1_1,"...She was a kind queen. \n But why did she write her third wish in her \n notebook?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_2_1,"...Hey, hey, is it true that Mr. Hideo is \n the prince of this country!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_2_2,"...No. Right now, I have to beat that bastard, \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_4_1,"...Even the disguised person \n forgot about that! \n That's quite an amazing feat!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_3_1,"Mr. Foster is Prince Ragas!?\n The queen's notebook is actually a lute... \n Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_1_1,"...I can't forgive that monster called Id! \n Let's hurry during the ritual!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_2_1,"...Let's leave him alone for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_4_1,"My notebook disappeared, but \n Now that I think about it, I don't need such a useful notebook \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_4_2,"Collecting junk with your own hands \n is the best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_3_1,"The Queen's third wish was for \n Prince Laguas..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_3_2,"Just like my mother \n She is such a kind mother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_1_1,"I was able to stop Id's plan, but \n It was a big sacrifice... \n If only I had more power...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_1,"...Laguas, you've put on a good face.\n Well, while we're together, I'll protect you, so \n I hope you'll follow me closely."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_2,"Yes! \n Thank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_4_1,"Would you like to use the power of Laguas to get some junk from this castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_4_2,"Hmm. I don't think there's any \n junk in this castle that Mr. Duston would be happy with..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_1,"Nice to meet you! \n But traveling with a prince \n makes me a little nervous."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_2,"Mr. Fuura, we are traveling together as \n friends, so you can just call me \n Laguas."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_3,"I can't just call you anything!\n...In that case, can I call you \n Laguas-kun?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_4,"Of course. \n Now, please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_5_1,"Let me \n help you in your battle!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1,"I never expected that the prince would follow me. \n Mr. {pc}'s fate is strange."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_2_1,"...Even though the king is absent,\n things are calm."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_4_1,"I want to go to that big windmill tower again to look for junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_3_1,"No matter when you come, flowers are dancing \n It looks like a fun town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_5_1,"Dad... \n Am I getting any closer to \n becoming a person worthy of being a king?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_1_1,"Despite all the sad things that happened, \n the people of this country are strong. \n I have to become stronger too."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1_1,"...I heard that Prince Laguas \n had a hard time as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1_2,"Yes.\n But now that you are here,\n it’s okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_2_1,"Is this the town where the queen who sings songs of blessings is?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_2_2,"I need to become well known in this town someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_4_1,"It's a restless town with water everywhere \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_4_2,"...No, no, this is the kind of town \n There might be some junk I haven't seen yet. \n Former Potsucon No. 2! Let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_3_1,"Wow!\n It's a very beautiful country, with waterways running throughout the town.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_1_1,"It's a town with great views and plenty of water. \n It's very different from Langao Village where I lived."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_5_1,"Queen Diore, who rules this country, is said to be respected by her subjects as a \n great prince. \n I must follow her example..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_2_1,"I heard some rumors, but \n Is this the song of raw blessings? \n When you listen to it up close, it's amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_4_1,"The young lady who was being chased by a dog earlier...\n I feel like there's a prank!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_4_2,"Mr. Duston is more interested in \n than the Queen's song..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_3_1,"Uh... wow.......\n Wonderful...."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_3_2,"...I'm so glad there was no \n song in the Kazefuri ceremony...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_1_1,"It's a beautiful song...\n People who can sing such songs are as cold as ice.\n I don't think that's the case..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_5_1,"Lord Diore is giving \n holy protection to the water all over the country. \n It's amazing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_2_1,"...Is he the prince of our country? \n I like the fact that he doesn't seem to be overbearing just because he's a prince, but I also feel like he's unreliable."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_4_1,"The fortune teller from earlier was being chased by a dog.\n Isn't she a young lady who seems to have good prospects?\n Was I wrong in my prediction?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_3_1,"You must be an amazing fortune teller to predict our arrival! \n I wonder if that person also heard voices from somewhere?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_1_1,"Is there something surprising...?\n You went out of your way to hide it in the labyrinth, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_5_1,"I don't think it's someone else's business.\n I want to be the prince's strength."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_2_1,"I was surprised….\n That girl is still alive…."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_4_1,"Hmm, those underground ruins...\n Looks like there's still something going on in my area. \n There's definitely some junk I haven't seen yet!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_3_1,"I feel sorry for \n being involved in some kind of incident and being locked up for \n all this time..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_1_1,"I'm not bad at helping people, but...\n That fortune teller...something's bothering me."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_5_1,"...A person like your father who \n sacrificed himself \n for his country in the past...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_2_1,"The rumor that the Queen and Prince are not on good terms...\nLooks like it's true."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_4_1,"I wanted to ask you if you \n could give me some junk from the castle, but it seems like \n there are no islands to attach to."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_3_1,"I wonder if the queen and the prince don't get along...? \n Since your mother is doing well, \n I hope they get along well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_1_1,"I wonder if the Queen knows about her daughter who was trapped in the labyrinth earlier...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_5_1,"I don't get listened to even if I express my opinion...\n Prince Odis' feelings...\n I feel like I understand a little bit too."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_2_1,"...I'm going to make him a prince.\n He's got a lot of nerve, isn't he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_2_2,"I'm sorry for being selfish. \n But I'm not a child anymore. \n I can't just do my mother's bidding forever."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_4_1,"This is a tropical ruin, I've never seen it before\n Looks like I'm expecting some junk!\n Kupupupupu!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_3_1,"I'm rooting for you, Odis. \n Good luck!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_3_2,"Thank you. \n I am truly grateful to you all."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_1_1,"{pc} made the decision, so \n I'll go with you, but shouldn't I \n talk to your mother a little more?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_1_2,"……."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_5_1,"Can I really explore \n the ruins that I will enter when I inherit the throne?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_2_1,"...Hmm. It's not our enemy, but \n it seems like it's a very important ruin to have even a guardian."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_4_1,"There's junk lying around all over the place.\n It's a very nice ruin!\n It's a shame that it's too heavy to take home!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_3_1,"Prince Odis \n Did you learn the song now?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_1_1,"There's even a guard there.\n As expected, it's a ruin connected to the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_5_1,"It seems that Prince Odis has been safely recognized as a member of the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_2_1,"...Hey, hey. \n Isn't it crazy that the seal is broken and the monsters wake up?\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_4_1,"That young lady has a wonderful dick!\n After all, she wasn't crazy in my eyes!\n I would definitely like to have her as my assistant."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_3_1,"Wow! \n Mr. {pc}, what should we do!? \n The sealed monster is about to wake up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_1_1,"{pc}-san, let's go! \n We have no choice but to stop \n the monster that was sealed away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_5_1,"Diore-sama may seem strict at first glance, but...\nShe is my mother after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_2_1,"...As expected from being called a tyrant, \n he was a powerful monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_4_1,"Ah, ah….\n That clunky young lady has gone.\n I was thinking of scouting her, but…."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_3_1,"The Queen and the Sealed Priestess \n were amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_1_1,"That fake fortune teller...\n I hope he doesn't do any harm again."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_5_1,"I was nervous when the \n seal of the monster that could destroy the world was broken, but thanks to everyone \n I was able to defeat it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_5_2,"Was I able to be of some help?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_1,"...Prince Odis has started to look quite \n nice."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_4_1,"Although he's not as good as that young lady, \n the prince of this country is quite a pompous one too. \n I kind of like him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_3_1,"I'm really glad that the queen and prince\n were able to reconcile.\n I hope you continue to cherish your mother."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_1,"I wonder if that monster had something to do with the Demon King?\nI defeated it, so it doesn't matter either way."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_5_1,"Don't give in to fake fortune-telling\n I have to work harder too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_2_1,"...Someday, I will \n accomplish something big by myself and \n make a name for myself!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_4_1,"I don't like that queen! \n There's quite \n something to see about the prince, though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_3_1,"Are the prince and the sealed shrine maiden \n doing well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_1_1,"Have you adjusted \n to this era, Celia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_1_1,"I wonder what kind of powerful monster \n was sealed in this land?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_5_1,"Are Queen Diore and Prince Odis getting along well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_5_1,"Queen Diore, who rules this country, is said to be respected by her subjects as a \n great monarch. \n I must follow her example..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_2_1,"Is this Gartland Castle Town?\n There are some strong-looking guys here."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_4_1,"They don't seem to be able to understand the pros and cons of junk.\n They're full of brutal people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_3_1,"This is Gartland Castle Town. \n Surrounded by large rocks, \n It feels like a town of ogre people."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_5_1,"King Grosner, who rules this town, \n is old, but his subjects trust him \n, and he is someone I respect as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_2_1,"...Hey, hey {pc}!\n Be careful!\n But that woman... is no ordinary person."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_4_1,"You must be a big loser \n to have your wallet stolen. \n Well, I looked it over!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_3_1,"Ah, that person is also a sage…?\n He has a different atmosphere than the other sages…"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_5_1,"Mr. {pc}, \n I'm glad you didn't take my money. \n Still, you're an amazing person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_2_1,"...Will the strong people disappear?\n Just because you went on a journey like me doesn't mean \n you're going to die, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_4_1,"These guys can only fight \n Just leave them alone!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_3_1,"That wise man uses healing techniques? \n Despite appearances, he is a kind person!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_5_1,"Strong people are disappearing...\n Is such a thing possible? \n It's a big problem for the country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_2_1,"...Those two are really into each other.\n I can understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_4_1,"It seems like it's okay to take it slow, so \n let's go look for some junk in the castle town."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_3_1,"Isn't that the place where there was a big bonfire \n that I passed on the way to Zama Beggar?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_5_1,"Mr. {pc}, let's go. \n I have a bad feeling..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_2_1,"...hey, hey, are you serious? \n That guy named Arold must have been pretty old in my opinion.\n But..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_4_1,"It would be sad if the junk disappeared, but \n it doesn't matter to me whether or not a seemingly capable ogre disappears!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_3_1,"Huh? Huh?\n You disappeared right in front of me? \n What do you mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_5_1,"That's it! Even Mr. Arold...\n What on earth is going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_2_1,"Is that old guy called Spindle really strong?\n I didn't see it that way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_2_2,"King Grosner relies on you, so \n I'm sure you'll be in good hands... \n Instead of that, let's find Arold quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_4_1,"Pirate hideout!? \n Looks like there's some nice junk \n there!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_3_1,"\n Sage-sama seems to be stronger than that Spindle-san..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_1_1,"I'm sorry for getting you involved.\nBut you guys are the only ones I can rely on..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_5_1,"The important item you delivered to Glen Castle is \n the \n necklace that {pc} told you about earlier, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_5_2,"Are you saying that that incident and this one are \n connected?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_2_1,"...It looks like that monster isn't \n the mastermind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_4_1,"It wasn't a big piece of junk!\n I was disappointed in my expectations!\n Pugiiiiii!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_3_1,"I feel sorry for Mr. Maille..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_1_1,"The clues are gone...\n Where is Arold!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_5_1,"That monster...\n You left something out that I'm curious about. \n Who are you talking about when you say you found it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_2_1,"...I thought \n that sage Sama was no ordinary person, but I never expected that he was the mastermind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_4_1,"Hmm...he won't come back to life.\n So you were connected to the former Potsucon No. 2?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_3_1,"The wise man is a monster...\n Even King Grosner and Mr. Spindle have been kidnapped... What should we do!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_1_1,"Mr. {pc}! Please! Lend me your power to \n defeat the Marines and rescue Arold and the others!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_5_1,"Marine and Juliante were \n looking for someone who had been brought back to life... in other words, Mr. {pc}...? I wonder why..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_2_1,"Tch! I missed one person. \n Is that clown one of the monsters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_4_1,"Moki!! \n If you're going to collect anything, you should collect \n junk rather than soldiers!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_3_1,"I'm glad that Mr. Arold, King Grosner, \n and the others are safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_1_1,"That voice from earlier. \n I wonder what that voice was..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_5_1,"I'm curious about that person that the escaped monster left behind... \n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_1,"...Is it okay?\n I left my fiance behind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_2,"I think \n what I need to do now is help {pc}. \n It's okay. Arold will understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_4_1,"Are you talking about key emblems again? Is this something embarrassing? \n I don't need something like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_1,"Did you hear the voice too, Maille-san? \n What? What?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_2,"Whatever... \n As I told Arold earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_1,"{pc}, everyone\n, thank you very much."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_1,"Mr. Maille heard that voice, too. \n So did we."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_2,"I see...\n Thank you for your continued support!\n Let's help {pc} together!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_2_1,"...There are still a lot of guys who look strong. \n I hope to meet them someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_4_1,"It's full of \n ogres that look as rough as ever!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_3_1,"Ogres, they are all big after all. \n Hehe. But we \n saved this country!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_1_1,"When I come here, I remember when I met {pc} and \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_5_1,"Looks like that monster friend, the clown \n, is no longer here."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_5_1,"King Grosner, who rules this town, \n is old, but his subjects trust him \n, and he is someone I respect as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_2_1,"...This is the royal capital of Kamiharumui. \n Isn't it a peaceful place?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_4_1,"This is a building that you don't see very often in other countries.\n This is a strange piece of junk.\n I'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_3_1,"This is the royal capital, Kamiharmui!\n It's bigger than Azran."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_1_1,"It's a beautiful town...\n It's so different from our Ogre town.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_5_1,"Looking at the flowers planted in the capital \n makes my heart feel soothed."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_2_1,"...Hmm. An abandoned castle, huh? \n That seems like a good idea."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_4_1,"Hoohoo! It's an abandoned castle! \n This guy has high expectations!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_3_1,"Is that Kyusuke from earlier?\n Just when I thought I had finally graduated from the Garden of Learning, \n he was working here..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_1_1,"A royal curse? \n It would be unwise of the king to go to such a terrifying place."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_5_1,"An incident in which members of the royal family died in a disturbing manner...\n A sacred place that lost its power..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_5_2,"Why is Mr. Nikolai \n going to such a dangerous place 50 years later?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_2_1,"...What is that now? Is it a ghost?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_4_1,"That’s great!\n Even just an abandoned castle is tempting\n A ghost that is useless just by looking at it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_3_1,"…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_3_2,"Hey Fuura! \n You look pale! Are you okay!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_1_1,"Those kids...\n I didn't think they were evil, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_5_1,"...What on earth is that now?\n It was more like a ghost...\n than a vision..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_2_1,"...Did what just happened here? \n It was certainly outrageous, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_4_1,"Hmm, it's useless... \n I don't think so. \n I don't like ghosts like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_1,"Yu… it’s not a ghost!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_2,"...That feels like a phantom. \n It doesn't seem like a ghost."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_3,"Well...that's fine, but...\n There's something \n you want to tell me, right? What is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_1_1,"...King Nikoloi is also worried.\n Let's go back to Kamihalmy Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_5_1,"This is...\n Is it a scene from the past, like the one I saw at my mother's villa...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_2_1,"...A cursed land. \n What kind of place is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_4_1,"That Kyusuke is my husband...\n It smells the same as Potsucon.\n I don't think he does...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_1,"It's nice to be able to help King Nikoloi, but \n I wonder if I'll be with Kyusuke..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_2,"You act like you've known me for a while, but\nAre you an acquaintance?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_3,"We were studying together in the Garden of Learning, and they were selling us useless junk like \n a magic drug that lets you memorize entire dictionaries."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_4,"...I think that's terrible, but how do you know it doesn't work?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_1_1,"Leaves of the Great Black Tree of the Cursed Earth...\n Did you really want something like that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_5_1,"I don't think that the apparition is meaningless. \n I think it's trying to tell you something, like it was with me."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_2_1,"Hey, hey, he's not coming.\n Well, it's better than having more trouble..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_4_1,"It's rumored that plants and trees can't grow properly on this \n cursed earth! There might be some wonderful \n junk sleeping in places like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_3_1,"I'm glad Kyusuke isn't coming with me, but \n That makes me kind of angry. \n You idiot!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_1_1,"The roots of that big tree are \n growing everywhere. \n Let's proceed using this as a landmark."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_5_1,"Everyone, please be careful.\n This land is contaminated with demonic miasma.\n There are poisonous swamps everywhere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_2_1,"...I never thought there would be a guard in a place like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_4_1,"It looks like a dead leaf and looks like it can't be used \n It's a leaf!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_3_1,"Those guards... \n They look a lot like the spirits of the World Tree that I heard about in the Garden of Learning \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_1_1,"Those leaves...\n It looked like they were waiting for {pc} to come."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_5_1,"The last remaining piece fell \n as if being sucked into it by \n {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_5_2,"Does that mean that you were recognized because you defeated those guards?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_2_1,"Are you heading to that ruined castle again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_4_1,"Gufufufu. Are you going to the abandoned castle again? \n I'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_3_1,"Eh! Are you going with Kyusuke!?\n...No way."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_3_2,"We studied at the same school, right?\n Oh, trust me."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_1_1,"That leaf...was it really a good idea to give it to King Nikoloi\n?\n I have a bad feeling about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_5_1,"Now that we have \n taken the leaves of the Great Dark Tree, I believe we have a responsibility \n to see it through to the end."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_2_1,"...What's going on?\n Appearances are appearing one after another. \n Is it because of the leaves of the Great Dark Tree?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_4_1,"As expected, this castle is full of \n wonderful junk... Gufufufu!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_3_1,"If that vision really happened, \n the queen should have recovered, but \n I wonder what happened...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_1_1,"There are so many illusions..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_5_1,"This is an illusion from the past after all...? \n What is the meaning behind the leaves of the Great Dark Tree?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_2_1,"I never expected that \n Queen Sama, who was thought to be dead, was put to sleep."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_4_1,"Do you still have something to do!?\n Is it okay if I just admire the junk around here?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_3_1,"You mean that the Queen showed a vision to \n King Nikoloi in order to protect the sacred place? \n The members of the royal family are amazing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_1_1,"So the queen was sealed away?\n King Nikoloi's older sister?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_5_1,"...Is this the reason we brought \n the leaves of the Great Dark Tree...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_2_1,"...I feel like Kyusuke, the old man \n took advantage of me, but \n I guess it's good that he was able to protect King Nikoloi as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_4_1,"When I'm at that sacred place, \n I feel a tingle down my back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_4_2,"I'm feeling nervous at the sacred place...\n Mr. Duston, it's not a monster, is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_3_1,"Wow! Kyusuke once again has a good point!\n He's really in a good mood!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_1_1,"We are responsible for delivering the leaves of the Great Dark Tree \n, so I'm glad we were able to resolve it safely."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_5_1,"Princess Rita...you followed \n the same path as my father..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_1,"...King Nikoloi also looked refreshed, as if he had gotten rid of his troubles."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_4_1,"There were no ghosts after all, right?\n Too bad!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_3_1,"...Kyusuke! \n You're doing great as always!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_1,"A lot of things happened, but \n I was able to regain the power of Eltona's sacred place, so \n it was really good."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_5_1,"King Nikoloi supported this country even after all that happened.\n I want to become strong like King Nikoloi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_2_1,"...I feel like the \n flowers are kinder than the last time I came."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_4_1,"I want to go to that abandoned castle again to admire the junk-chan and the others."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_3_1,"Someday, I want Azlan to become a splendid town that rivals the royal capital."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_1_1,"I'm really glad I was able to protect this beautiful town."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_1_1,"It's a beautiful town...\n It's so different from \n our Ogre town."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_5_1,"I want to protect the country like King Nikoloi."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_5_1,"Flowers are dancing in this town too, and it reminds me of \n Megistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_2_1,"Is this the Dollworm Kingdom?\n I was wondering what kind of place it would be since it's in the desert, but \n Isn't it a nice town?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_4_1,"I don't like it, but every time I look at it, it's amazing! \n This country's mechanism is amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_4_2,"I don't like it because \n it's just a bunch of useful tricks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_3_1,"Wow, that's amazing...\n The roads and buildings are all made of stone!\n It's completely different from Eltona."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_1_1,"This is amazing. \n It's more like a town... or rather, a huge royal palace."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_5_1,"It seems that in the royal family of this country, when twins are born, one of them is abandoned in order to prevent \n a power struggle between siblings."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_5_2,"...Someday, if I have children, \n I would like to raise them so that siblings don't fight with each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_2_1,"...Hey, hey, what's this guy?\n He just came into the party without permission."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_1,"What is that?! You! \n You're calling the former Potsucon No. 2 a servant instead of me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_2,"Huh? What? I'm sure Lunana-sama's \n servant is better than an \n old man like you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_3,"Moki!!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_3_1,"I...I suddenly became a servant...\n This lady is so scary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_1_1,"The magic stone...!\n I can't believe it's capable of doing that!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_5_1,"It's a great discovery to change the direction of the magic stone's power and make it \n the stone of the sun! \n Director Dura... He's an amazing person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_2_1,"...It's really hot considering it's a volcano. \n Let's finish what we need to do and head back."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_1,"What's the fun in collecting stones that everyone wants\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_2,"You! \n If you cat-baby the demon stone, \n it won't happen for free!!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_3,"You're such a rude person! \n I don't need something useful like that \n even if I die!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_3_1,"It's dangerous to touch it directly...\n I wonder what will happen if I touch it...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_1_1,"It's amazing technology that they even developed a cloth to carry the miasma stones home."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_5_1,"If we could turn this much magic stone into \n the Stone of the Sun...\n I think we would be able to gain tremendous power."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_2_1,"...hey, hey.\n This time it slipped out on its own, didn't it?\n What's that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_4_1,"Hmph!\n You don't understand the value of things! \n How can you appreciate such things!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_3_1,"Even though we defeated the monster, \n it's just a tiny stone like this \n It's too terrible..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_1_1,"Lunana-san is like a storm...\n Let's go back to Dollarworm."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_5_1,"It seems that \n that magical stone was sealed in Ofuda, but \n was it really a good idea to bring it back...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_2_1,"...It's a sad song.\n It's unacceptable for parents to abandon their children."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_4_1,"When you're a baby, all you do is cry and cry.\n It's cute, but isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_4_2,"Chili was fine at first, but \n she gradually started saying things like she wanted to be helpful to her father... and \n unfilial things, which was annoying!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_3_1,"That’s it…\n I can’t decide between choosing a country or a child.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_1_1,"It's a song with some kind of meaning.\n I thought it was a story from the past, but \n I was born again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_5_1,"That song... I heard \n from my father about the folklore surrounding the Dolworm Kingdom \n Could it be..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_2_1,"...Hmph! \n If it wasn't for us, we wouldn't have been able to bring back such a big \n demon stone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_4_1,"I wonder why everyone would want such an embarrassing key emblem."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_3_1,"Even though we helped you, \n you told me to thank you... \n That's too much!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_1_1,"You really brought it back after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_5_1,"If you can really turn that much demon stone into a sun stone, \n I think it would be a great invention that could save the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_2_1,"...Hey, hey. Looks like you've \n dug up the bad guy."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_4_1,"Isn't that Chili from earlier? \n By the way, you said something about working \n in the Dolworm Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_4_2,"It doesn't matter, I completely forgot about it.\n You're still trying to say things that are helpful to people and \n nonsense."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_3_1,"It was Chili-san! \n I wonder if you could transform into Poicrin-sama again and solve the problem in a flash."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_1_1,"\n monsters were sealed in that demon stone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_5_1,"The twin children that Director Dura abandoned...?\n So that song was true after all...\n How cruel..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_2_1,"...I managed to defeat it, but \n you left something out that bothers me. \n It's a curse, and despair never ends... or something like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_4_1,"Hmm. Prince Ramiza seems to have quite a talent as \n will appear after the story is over."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_3_1,"Prince Ramiza, I was even thinking about the \n family of the knights I fight with... \n You're such a kind person."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_1_1,"We were able to defeat him safely, but the rift between the brothers has become even wider."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_5_1,"I hope that the two of you will take this opportunity to join hands and become friends."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_1,"...I never expected that Duston's daughter was \n the abandoned princess of the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2,"Well, I don't think Duston cares whether he's royalty or not."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_3,"Of course! \n Such cheap values ​​\n I don't care!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_4_1,"...I didn't see anything! \n I didn't ask!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_4_2,"Chile is my unfilial daughter!\n Always has been and always will be!\n That’s it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_1,"Director Dura, Prince Ramiza\n and Mr. Chili...\n Looks like we'll continue to get along well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_2,"Mr. Duston, are you lonely?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_3,"Hmph! Such an unfilial girl should just go wherever she wants and do whatever she wants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_1,"This country has really been saved this time.\n I'm sure they will protect this country for a long time\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_5_1,"Director Dura's hard work was a mistake this time, but \n I feel like I understand her feelings."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2_1,"The Chilean guy ended up not living in the royal palace. \n Isn't it the same as before? \n Things have changed, like Duston is better."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2_2,"Moky!! Mukyakya!!\n Thank you for your help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_4_1,"Now, let’s go find the next piece of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_4_2,"Mr. Duston...maybe you are trying not to meet \n Mr. Chili?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_3_1,"I'd like to see Poiclin in action again."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_1_1,"I was surprised that Mr. Duston's daughter was such a strong young lady. On the other hand, I guess she's a teacher..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_1_1,"I find it hard to believe that Mr. Duston has a daughter\n who is actually the princess of this country."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_5_1,"With those three people, this country will be safe.\n I have to do my best not to lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_5_1,"Choose your country or your child...\n I pray that the day when I have to make such a decision will never come.\n I want to choose a different path!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_2_1,"...have you finally arrived? \n It's boring while riding."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_4_1,"...Well, I slept well!\n I thought it would be convenient and trivial, but\n The comfort of sleeping is quite good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}!\n The Ark of the Earth is amazing!\n We reached another continent in no time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_2_1,"...I don't know, but that ride makes me sleepy."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_4_1,"...Well, I slept well! \n As always, the comfort of my sleep was great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_3_1,"It swayed with a certain rhythm \n It was so comfortable that I fell asleep! \n {pc}, weren't you sleepy?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_2_1,"...hey {pc}.\n You look pale, are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_4_1,"It's still a comfortable vehicle! \n If it breaks down, I'd like to take it back."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_3_1,"{pc}-sama, are you okay?\n I think you were upset..."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_2_1,"What's wrong {pc}?\n You look more serious than usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_4_1,"...Fuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\n I haven’t had enough sleep yet.\n Can I ride again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_3_1,"I thought I would wake up and look at the scenery this time, but \n I fell asleep again... \n Dear {pc}, please don't laugh, okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_2_1,"...Hey, hey. That old man said all the big things \n, but he failed."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_2_2,"So what are we going to do?\n Just like that old man said, are we heading to Glen Castle Town?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_4_1,"The Heart of Hades... In other words, it's the Castle of Hades!? \n I have a feeling that there's going to be some incredible junk \n! Pug!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_3_1,"Even with the power of Sage Hollow-sama, \n cannot be reached... \n {pc}-sama, what should we do?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_2_1,"...No matter who you are right now, it is \n {pc} who traveled with us! It's you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_4_1,"That stupid personality!\n Eyes that don't show any motivation!\n That's great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_3_1,"Even if Mr. {pc} is someone else, \n the one who saved me and traveled with me is \n Mr. {pc} now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_3_2,"I believe in {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_2_1,"I can't believe we're going 500 years ago, but \n Look, {pc}! \n Make sure you come back safely!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_1,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\n Could you leave this guy behind for a moment in the world of 500 years ago?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_2,"Duston-san, don't try to make junk \n, it's no good...And since it's junk, \n you'll probably get thrown away."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_3,"Hmph!\n It's really unfortunate that people don't understand the merits of junk.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\n Please be careful when you go.\n...I feel bad that I can't help you."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_90_HIMEA_1,"Nice to meet you, {pc}. \n If I follow you, \n I think I can become that girl's power."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_99_HIMEA_1,"...It looks like she went off alone.\n But that's no good.\n Let's hurry up and catch up."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_100_HIMEA_1,"...She still doesn't understand.\n You can't do it alone. It's no good."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_100_HIMEA_2,"Mr. {pc}. \n Let's get the ice bird's wings before that girl and \n take them to Mr. Foster."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_110_HIMEA_1,"...She said let's go together.\n Hehe. Maybe she's changed a little?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_HIMEA_1,"...There's no way I could convince \n to return Glen Castle to the Ogres."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_HIMEA_2,"...But if it's the current Herge, I think \n maybe."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_GARUMII_1,"Hey humans and elves!\n I won't be fooled!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_GARUMII_2,"Wow. All the kids have gathered.\n Mr. Garumi... no, Garumii.\n Look forward to working with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_HIMEA_1,"...Erge's plan is truly a mess."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_HIMEA_2,"But...that's why I have to do it.\nMaybe for this occasion..."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_GARUMII_1,"...You're such a human being \n Why... Why?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_HIMEA_1,"...He really came to Raydames!\n If this happens, we'll have no choice but to do something\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_GARUMII_1,"He... he's so desperate... \n He's really stupid."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_GARUMII_2,"If this happens, I'll see you all the way to Saigo! \n I'll create a future that isn't so cool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_141_HIMEA_1,"...This flame seems to have some kind of secret.\n I wonder if there are others?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_141_GARUMII_1,"...The flames have disappeared.\n What is this?\n Is it okay if we defeat them all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_HIMEA_1,"For the sake of our future \n I can never lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_GARUMII_1,"...Chikusho!\n Next time, I'll beat you all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_GARUMII_2,"That human... look where Herju is heading!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_2_1,"...It looks like you returned safely. \n Well, I thought you would do well.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_4_1,"So… so… what kind of junk was it from 500 years ago \n?!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_3_1,"Welcome home, {pc}!\n ...Eh? Have you met Himea-sama?\n ...Eh? Even Yakuru-sama!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_3_2,"All I know about Yakuru-sama is what I learned \n in the Garden of Learning, but \n I was able to meet such an amazing person!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_2_1,"...It looks like we'll be able to go to the Hades this time.\n The bell is ringing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_4_1,"It looks like we're finally going to meet Hades' junk! \n I'm sure it's some incredible junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! Let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_2_1,"Huh? A polite welcome greeting, huh? \n Wash your neck and wait for me, Nergel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_4_1,"Is this the heart of the Hades?\n I have a feeling that you'll find some ridiculous junk in the evil shumi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_3_1,"Fifi-chan worked hard too\n We have to do our best too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_1_1,"That's the voice of Hades Nergel, right? \n Look, I'll definitely defeat you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_5_1,"Mom, dad...\n Please watch.\n I'll finish it soon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_2_1,"Dammit...! I won't lose next time! \n {pc} Let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_4_1,"...Hmph! \n I never give up on the junk I'm aiming for!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_4_2,"I'll definitely turn that Hades' heart into junk and bring it home!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_3_1,"If it was me in the past, I would have definitely given up, but \n I am different now. \n Dear {pc}! Let's try again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_1_1,"...Nergel!\n Next time I won't lose!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_5_1,"I can still fight!\n I can't leave Hades alone!\n {pc}-san, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_2_1,"Ah…….\n It’s over, really."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_4_1,"Castle junk!\n We'll see you again soon!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_3_1,"Hey, {pc}.\n This isn't a dream, right?\n We really did it, right!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_1_1,"Arold...\nMy journey was worth it."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_5_1,"Mom, Dad….\n Have I become closer to the king like my father?　"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_2_1,"Next time you're going to Rendersia, right? \n I can't even imagine what it's like, but \n I need to train hard.　"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_4_1,"Next, I’m going to collect \n the junk I haven’t seen yet in Rendersia!! Kupupupupup!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_3_1,"Dear {pc}\n Next, you're going to Rendersia, right?\n Of course I'm going too, so let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_1_1,"If you are going to Rendersia, \n you must train. \n {pc}, thank you for your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_5_1,"This trip made me realize how immature I am.\n Until the day I can proudly return to my country\n Thank you very much, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_1_1,"{pc}, everyone\n, thank you very much."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_5_1,"If {pc} is involved, \n my predictions won't work..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_2_1,"...It didn't seem to resonate much."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_2_2,"I guess so. \n It seems like you were a little worried about us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_4_1,"She's still a good-looking girl without any training \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_3_1,"Hehe. Fifi-chan, it seems like you care \n about us."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_1_1,"Is that the heir of Hajashu that everyone was talking about? \n He really doesn't seem to have any motivation..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_5_1,"I can understand a little bit how Fifi-san and Fuura-san feel \n.\n Fuura-san! Let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_5_2,"Yeah! \n Let’s do our best, Laguas-kun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_2_1,"...I feel like he's changed somehow. \n His attitude is the same as always, but \n he's a lot more motivated."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_4_1,"Hmm, I thought she was a floppy girl with a lot to offer \n, but I guess I was wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_3_1,"Hehe. Fifi-chan\n You're really motivated.\n Just a little more... just a little more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_1_1,"...I can hardly believe that you were listless and just reading books."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_5_1,"Mr. Fifi, you're very motivated. \n We can't afford to lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_2_1,"Wow! That kid finally did it!\n Now you can go to the Heart of Hades!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_4_1,"Ah, ah...\n I'm totally motivated.\n It's a shame that it seems like I'm watching Chile's childhood."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_3_1,"You did it, {pc}!\n Fifi-chan learned \n the Hajashu technique!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_3_2,"I can also support and \n encourage others..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_1_1,"Finally, we can ride \n to Hades King Nergel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_5_1,"It's finally the decisive battle with Hades...\n Mr. {pc}\n Let's prepare well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_2_1,"...In the end, there's nothing we can do.\n Even the wise old man can't be trusted."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_4_1,"For a child, there's nothing sparkly about him.\n He seems to have given up on something...\n There's a lot to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_1,"Dear {pc}...\n I understand how Fifi-chan feels."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_2,"The adults around me have high expectations for me, but what should I do if I can't live up to their expectations...\n Do I really have that kind of power?"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_3,"But {pc}-sama and the others \n gave me courage. \n Next time, I want to be that girl's power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_2_1,"There are still a lot of guys who look strong. \n I hope to meet them someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_4_1,"It's full of \n ogres that look as rough as ever!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_3_1,"Ogres, they're all big after all. \n Hehe. But we \n saved this country!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_5_3,"Yes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_3,"I see.\n As expected, \n you haven't said anything clearly."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_3,"Yes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_2_1,"Is it the Rendersia continent...\n I guess there are strong guys out there, right?\n The sound is ringing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_4_1,"When on earth will I be able to go to Rendersia? \n The junk is waiting for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_3_1,"Dear {pc}\n Rendersia is your hometown... right? \n Do you feel nostalgic?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsNotOgre_4_1,"What kind of person is this brave princess who has awakened \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsNotOgre_4_2,"After all, considering he's a hero, he seems \n strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsOgre_4_1,"That light that saved Giganf\n was proof of his awakening."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsOgre_4_2,"The hero who emitted that light is \n beyond this sea."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_5_1,"Sage Holo-sama said \n that eventually I would be able to go to \n Rendersia, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_5_2,"Route... Is it the port town of Lendor?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_2_1,"If the compass doesn't get fixed, I won't be able to \n go to Rendersia. \n What a hassle..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_4_1,"I don't know if it's a magnetic stone or if I'm going to hell, but\n It's humiliating to look for something that could be useful like that!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_3_1,"You can get the Infinite Magnetic Stone from either \n of two types of monsters. \n Which one would you choose, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_1_1,"Many people will be in trouble if the ship doesn't leave port.\n Let's help gather the materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_5_1,"This is what the wise Hollow-sama was talking about: \n the restoration of the sea route to Rendersia...\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_5_2,"Let's hurry and gather materials to go to that place."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_2_1,"The compass moves \n with a stone like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_4_1,"Let's deliver the stones we managed to find \n quickly!\n We don't need anything that is useful to people!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_3_1,"I just need to \n deliver this stone and the magic stone to the concierge at the inn, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_1_1,"Infinite magnetic stone...\n It's an amazing name, but \n it doesn't look much different from a normal stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_5_1,"I see. This infinite magnetic stone allows you to use your \n compass even in the fog of \n confusion."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_1,"Just a monster that dropped a stone \n isn't even a warm-up exercise. \n Isn't there a stronger one?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_2,"When we get to Rendersia, we may have to fight \n stronger enemies. \n Isn't it better to save up your stamina?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_3,"...I understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_4_1,"Isn't there a junk exchange ticket?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_3_1,"If you take the exchange ticket with you, \n you can exchange it for a ship pass to Rendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_1_1,"What you're getting is not a boarding pass.\n You can't exchange it unless you give the exchange ticket..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_5_1,"You can only receive \n boarding passes at the ship management office in the port town of Rendor..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_5_2,"I see. Only trusted people can board the \n ship."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_1,"Well done. \n Let's quickly board the Grand Titus."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_2,"We have to save the world and make \n the kids feel safe \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_3,"...Hyuza-san is very caring."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_1,"Rendersia...\n An unknown land! A country I have never seen before!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_2,"What a worthless thing! \n What a piece of crap! What a piece of junk! \n I wonder if you'll wait for me!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_3,"I'm not confused, Mr. Duston...\n When I heard about your daughter Chili from everyone, \n I took a second look."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_3_1,"It's finally Rendersia...\n What kind of place is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_1_1,"You're finally ready to set sail.\n I'm so excited to be on a big ship."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_1_2,"I hope I can ride with Arold someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_1,"If you go to Rendersia, \n you will have to take care of \n your uncle for a while..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_2,"But this is the journey I wanted on my own!\n What I have to do is not finished yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_3,"And I want to become the king of Megistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_4,"...I'm sure your father and mother \n would like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_2_1,"That man with the hat...\n I felt like he was trying something against the guy who was selling the boarding pass..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_2_2,"He's a suspicious guy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_4_1,"Even though I'm surrounded by all these expensive-looking things, I can't run away because I'm on the ocean!\n I feel like shit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_3_1,"Something this big floats on \n water... \n It's strange..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_1_1,"I feel sorry for the person who bought the boarding pass in front of the ship... \n Even though they had already paid the advance fee, \n they got scolded because of a misunderstanding."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_1_2,"But something seems a little strange..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_5_1,"Even with such a well-built ship, \n it would be impossible to reach \n Rendersia without a magical compass..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_5_2,"Are the people of Rendersia safe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_2_1,"I don't understand \n being ordered by a guy called Crows, but now \n I have no choice but to go after the sailors who left."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_4_1,"That guy called Crows \n To destroy someone else's memory \n is an incredible power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_4_2,"Former Potsukon No. 2.\n If you get crushed, \n I'll make you my assistant again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_3_1,"There are a lot of things that are questionable, but... \n But it also seems like I can rely on you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_3_2,"That Crows guy \n makes me feel a little confused!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_1_1,"He said Crows. \n Who is he...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_1_2,"Now let's chase the red-haired sailor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_5_1,"I feel like I'm being made to dance by that guy called Crows."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_5_2,"Still, as he said, why don't you head to the first floor deck?\n If my hunch is correct..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_2_1,"Hey, hey, if you had been thrown into the sea like that, \n were you planning on making us look for it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_2_2,"But, with this, I think I'll be able to reach \n Rendersia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_1,"Are you going to sleep already?\n If you have time like that, \n I want to look for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_2,"Looking for junk \n, old man, do it by yourself."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_3,"Gunnunnu.\n These people don't understand the merits of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_3_1,"Mr. Crows\n was a great person."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_3_2,"I hope there's nothing \n to do until we get to Rendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_1_1,"The Dark King Nergel ordered his demons to \n thwart the people heading towards Rendersia..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_1_2,"Anyway, Mr. Crows...\n It's said that you have the power to defeat that monster in one blow.\n You need to be careful after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_5_1,"Who the hell is Mr. Crows?\n He seems like an elusive person."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_1,"For some reason, \n it seems we arrived at a different place than our destination, but \n we were able to land in Rendersia anyway."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_2,"Ha! Don't worry. \n I never thought I'd be able to go \n without any trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_3,"That's right. It's a journey to save the world.\n It's always a hassle."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_4_1,"Even though there is such a thing as a magic compass, \n I can't arrive at my destination properly.\n...That's a good omen!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_4_2,"Come on! The junk of Rendersia is \n waiting for us!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_3_1,"This is Rendersia.\n But why?\n I can't hear the wind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_3_2,"I don't understand what the voice of the wind is, but \n something is certainly wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_1_1,"It was fun to be on the boat for a short time.\n But I think traveling on my own is more suitable for me."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_5_1,"Mr. Crows left earlier, but \n I have a feeling we'll see him again soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_5_2,"No…not a prediction, but somehow."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_2_1,"Three butterflies? \n Why do the butterflies have anything to do with going to Gran Zedora?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_2_2,"I don't know much about butterflies, but \n you helped me on the Grand Titus, so I'm sure it has some meaning."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_4_1,"I'm sure some wonderful junk is waiting for me on the other side of that gate!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_4_2,"I'm going to scare the three butterflies \n I'll definitely pass through that gate!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_3_1,"Mr. Crows \n, you know everything."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_3_2,"...But why \n would you tell us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_1_1,"I have to go to Gran Zedora quickly and meet the Hero Princess."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_1_2,"I can't take \n what Mr. Crows says too much, but \n I have no other choice, so I can't help it."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_5_1,"Mr. Crows...\n As I expected, we met again."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_5_2,"Anyway, it's a butterfly...?\n Is it an analogy for something?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_2_1,"Is the butterfly that Crows was talking about \n the one you received earlier?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_2_2,"But it's a butterfly... \n It doesn't even look like a key, so how can I go to \n Gran Zedora with this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_3_1,"Butterflies...\n As Mr. Crows said, \n it really happened."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_3_2,"It wasn't a real butterfly, but...\n Should I just collect three like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_1_1,"Even if I collect butterflies, I have no idea how \n I can open the gate with this...\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_1_2,"There's no point in thinking about it. \n I guess we have no choice but to do as Mr. Crows told us \n and collect the three butterflies."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_5_1,"...As expected, it wasn't about a real butterfly."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_5_2,"How did \n Mr. Crows know that this was available in the first place?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_4_1,"Why are you forcing \n something of value on me!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_4_2,"I'll endure it to pass the Sanmon barrier, but \n I'd be happier if I received \n some useless junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_2_1,"Now that all three butterflies are together, \n the gate will finally open. It's been quite a journey so far."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_3_1,"Dear {pc}!\n Now you can pass through the Sanmon barrier!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_1_1,"Finally, you have gathered three butterflies.\n There were a lot of things.\n I have a lot of feelings for all of them."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_5_1,"The three butterflies Mr. Crows said \n have gathered together."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_5_2,"But what is he planning to do with this butterfly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_4_1,"Now that we have gathered three butterflies, we can say goodbye to \n the humiliating days of helping others and being appreciated!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_4_2,"\n Garakuta-chan is waiting for you on the other side of the Sanmon Checkpoint!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_2_1,"...What do you mean?\n Crows guy\n Did he trick us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_3_1,"Eh?! \n Even if you collect three butterflies, they won't let you through?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_3_2,"Mr. Crows, it didn't look like \n you were lying though."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_1_1,"...I guess we have no choice but to go \n to the Kingdom of Granzedora in another way?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_5_1,"I can't force myself to go through the gate, so I guess I have no choice but to turn back."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_4_1,"The butterflies I worked so hard to obtain are of no use to me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_4_2,"That Crows guy \n understands what I'm talking about!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_2_1,"...Are there monsters in this village? \n The siblings from earlier seem to be wandering around here without any problem. Are they okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_4_1,"It's a somewhat run-down village! \n This is something to look forward to!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_1,"Suddenly, something happened!'' \n Do we look that suspicious?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_2,"There are some suspicious people though."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_3,"Don’t praise me like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_1_1,"You said \n that we were monster's minions. \n Maybe this village has some kind of problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_1_2,"I wish there was something I could do for \n the village children who protected us earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_5_1,"You were feeling quite tingly.\n Is something going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_2_1,"The hero of the village is going to take revenge with the monster...?\n Since it's a good opportunity, let's make a deal\n I was hoping..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_2_2,"Everyone is in trouble now that he's gone.\n Let's do what we can to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_4_1,"Is it a ghost with just a part of its body?\n Hmm, it's quite intriguing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_3_1,"Ghost! ...You mean a monster, right?\n ...Really a ghost \n I don't like it."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_1_1,"Is that girl named Laska \n okay? I'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_5_1,"…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_5_2,"I'm sorry...\n When I was looking at Mr. Raska and Mayor Gash, \n I remembered my father."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_1,"Hey, what kind of monster are you \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_2,"I haven't seen it directly either, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_3,"It's just parts of the dismembered body, like the head and legs...\n It seems that it feels different from monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_3_1,"Mr. Kope, \n why do you live apart from \n everyone in Mersandi village?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_3_2,"The old lady is the caretaker of the waterwheel, but she's a bit difficult...\n She's actually a very kind person."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_1_1,"You said Mishua-san. \n It seems like the village is in trouble.\n Are you glad that you came with us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_1_2,"It's okay.\n I'm worried about my grandmother too.\n I'm sure Raska will be happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_4_1,"Hmph! I hate things like waterwheels that are useful to everyone!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_5_1,"Laska-san...\n I hope you can make up with Mayor Gash."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_2_1,"She's such a shrewd old lady. \n I never thought she'd pick me up and \n force me to do chores."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_4_1,"I don't want to fix a broken water wheel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_4_2,"But the inside of the abandoned watermill \n is a bit worrying!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_1,"Time is gold!\n...Those are words that make me think."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_2,"Huh? Do you even want \n money?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_3,"No. I mean time is as important as money\n, but the time I lost is something that money cannot buy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_4,"That's right. We also \n don't waste our time in a place like this \n and want to save the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_3_1,"Mr. Kope...\n You said something about your belly button, but \n You're definitely worried about Raska-kun."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_1_1,"Quickly fix the gears in the watermill and take \n Kope-san back to the village chief \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_2_1,"You're such a stubborn old woman that you want someone to steal something from you."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_4_1,"Even though I dug up the stream, I didn't find any junk at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_5_1,"Kopé-san, I guess you really want to meet \n Laska-san."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_3_1,"I wonder how much it would have cost if I sold that big jewel \n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_1,"That numb jellyfish...\n Did you want to thank us by giving us the jewels?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_2,"But Kope-san took \n the jewelry..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_3,"It looks \n difficult to get Kope-san to give it back to you. \n I'm sorry for that numb jellyfish, but let's give up..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_1,"Kopé-san, you seemed happy to meet Laska-kun \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_2,"That's right. Anyway, \n I didn't expect you to give me the jewels back. \n I guess you were really happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_3,"It was originally a \n gem that {pc} gave me."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_4,"Even if I received something valuable like jewelry, \n I would not be happy at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_2_1,"What a hassle, old lady.\n But I'm looking forward to the Bipple Room.\n Let's go to the inn quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_1,"Biplume is \n a rather clunky name."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_2,"VIP room means \n a room for important customers. \n It seems like they are very grateful."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_3,"Hey! You're such an important customer!\n Please stop treating me so badly!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_5_1,"I'm relieved that Mr. Kope was able to safely meet the village chief and \n Laska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_5_2,"But where on earth is the butterfly Mr. Crows was talking about \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_1_1,"The \n Big Room at the inn in Melsandi Village...\n I wonder what it's like?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_2_1,"I have to go rescue the kidnapped guy. \n Let's head to the plaza to the west of the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_1_1,"The monster that just left the village...\n It's the monster the village chief was talking about, right?\n If someone has been kidnapped, we need to help it quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_4_1,"Is it a monster with giant hands...\n Isn't there a monster with earlobes that looks more chunky than that?\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_5_1,"It's tough...! \n Let's hurry to the \n Komorebi Square located west of the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_3_1,"Even though it only has hands, it's a monster so big that it can drag people away!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_3_2,"I'm...scared, but \n {pc}-sama, as long as I'm with you all, \n I'll be fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_2_1,"Laska guy, even though he's a kid, \n don't be so reckless...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_2_2,"But I have to admit that you have such a strong heart!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_1_1,"Laska-kun, it's pointless to do it alone! \n Let's chase after him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_4_1,"Inside the well where a monster lives...\n This guy feels like a junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_5_1,"Let's chase the hand ghost too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_5_2,"I can't help my child\n That disgusted face of the Gash village chief...\n I can't abandon him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_3_1,"{pc}-sama \n Let's go help Mishua-san! \n I can't leave Laska-kun alone either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_2_1,"I guess the hero Zankrone is still alive. \n If Laska's story is true, I didn't think he would die so easily \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_3_1,"The person who was kidnapped before \n was also safe! \n I'm glad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_3_2,"Looks like Mishua went home first, so \n I feel safe now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_1,"I've reached a point of relief, but... \n Who on earth was that ghost with that hand \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_2,"It wasn't just a monster...\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_3,"The village hero, Mr. Zancrone, \n Why is he so small... \n It's full of mysteries."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_1_1,"Hero Zankrone is small but \n very strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_1_2,"I think I can understand \n why Laska-kun respects me."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_4_1,"I can't believe you don't have a single piece of junk.\n Why did that monster have that \n hand shape?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_1,"Mishua...is completely different \n He's become a different person.\n Who is that Mishua...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_2,"Hey, Laguas!\n Do you understand what I mean?\n Why has Mishua changed?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_3,"...No, I don't feel refreshed either."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_4_1,"Even though that Mishua girl has been replaced, \n no one notices... \n I'm starting to like this village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_3_1,"I thought Mr. Zancrone had returned to \n the village as well, but \n he wasn't there."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_3_2,"Did you go somewhere to get rid of \n ghosts again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_1_1,"I wonder where that Mr. Mishua we met went \n to? \n I can't believe there are two Mr. Mishuas..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_1_2,"Something just doesn't make sense."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_5_1,"I don't understand \n about Mishua either..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_5_2,"This hair ornament is the \n butterfly that Mr. Crows was talking about...what is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_2_1,"He was such a cheeky kid...\nFor now, let's go to the church on the hill.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_3_1,"Queen of a town full of children...\n Might be kinda cool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_1_1,"Sered, a town only for children...?\n Are there really no adults? \n Isn't that dangerous...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_1_2,"I can't tell you unless I ask you the details \n so let's go to the church on the hill."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_5_1,"Where on earth did the adults of Seredo Town go?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_5_2,"The girl who was called the Queen had \n a monster as her butler, so \n there are a lot of things I don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_4_1,"Is this a town full of children only...?\n Looks like there's some nice junk there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_2_1,"Shall I bring you the dragon's tail?\n Is this what that cheeky Queen Sama was talking about\n to judge the honorary child?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_3_1,"It's not like that cool queen will judge \n. \n I thought we could talk, but I'm sorry."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_1_1,"If it's a Battle Rex, \n I saw it near the town of Ceredo. \n Let's go."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_5_1,"You defeat the \n Battle Rex that is on the Ceredot Mountain Path and obtain the \n Dragon Tail."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_4_1,"I don't want to pass the examination\n or do anything that would be recognized by others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_2_1,"You have obtained the dragon's tail.\n Let's quickly go to the \n church on the hill in Seredo town."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_3_1,"You did it! Hurry up and take it to the church on the hill in \n in Seredo town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_3_2,"I guess I passed the exam now.\n Passed... That sounds great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_1_1,"Shall I take the dragon's tail to the gatekeeper's child? \n The Queen should be waiting for you too."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_5_1,"It was okay because it was us, but \n it would be quite difficult for a normal adult to get a \n dragon tail."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_5_2,"Why would you go to such lengths and \n not want an adult to be with you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_4_1,"You want a dragon's tail, not horns or fangs.\n There's a little bit of hope!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_2_1,"I brought the dragon's tail, but now I have to say hello to Queen Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_2_2,"You're really excited for a game."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_3_1,"I wonder if there will be a presentation of the results at a church on a hill?\n Hey...I'm a little nervous."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_1_1,"The girl who was called Queen seems to be difficult, but\n I'm worried if she really accepts my presence in town.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_5_1,"Well...I hope that now you can understand the situation in Seredo town even a little bit."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_4_1,"Now that I've passed the exam, \n I have to take the junk in the church.\n It's not worth it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_2_1,"Those kids...\n They seem to be having fun, but\n Are they really okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_3_1,"I wonder if the honorary child will skip snacks….\n Uh, no! It’s nothing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_5_1,"I thought \n that the town was being ruled by just children... \n Is it okay with such rules?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_4_1,"Honorary child?\n I don't need honor!\n I'm very happy to be a dishonorable adult!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_1,"There are really only children. \n I can see how Liselotta brings everyone together."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_2,"However, \n I feel bad for Fuura and Prince Laguas if the honorary child skips snacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_3,"I'm fine without snacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_2_1,"The kids are eating nothing but snacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_2_2,"Eating only what you like is bad for your health."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_1,"…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_2,"...What's wrong?\n Are you in a bad mood because you can't eat snacks?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_3,"No, that's wrong! You just said...\n You didn't need the adults to come back.\n Is that really okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_4,"...Now then.\n There are kids who want adults to pay attention to them, and \n there are kids who find them annoying."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_1,"If you can command your familiar \n to give you whatever you want, then \n it's no wonder you're called Queen."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_2,"But how long can we continue to live like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_3,"I'm also curious about the \n plan you mentioned earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_4_1,"Is that familiar named Muccino able to take out junk too?\n I'm interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_1_1,"I've been inviting the adults to pray \n for their return...\n No one is paying attention."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_1_2,"Don't you all want the adults to \n come back?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_3_1,"I don't like being lectured, but \n I don't like it even more that the adults disappear."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_3_2,"Mr. {pc}, Mr. Mayu, Mr. Huza\n... Mr. Duston is also a bit strange, but\n there are many good people."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_1_1,"...That girl named Liselotta\n I can't do it...I hope she doesn't."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_1_2,"She may be desperate to take the place of an adult."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_5_1,"Where have all the adults in town disappeared to?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_5_2,"You said that it disappeared due to a failure in summoning, but is it really so convenient that only adults can disappear?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_2_1,"I'm sorry that the adults are gone.\n...I don't want Saumya to hear \n what I just said."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_4_1,"Failing the ritual and erasing the adults \n is quite a bummer! \n There's a lot to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_2_1,"Even though Firo is desperately trying to stop her, \n that Queen Sama...\n is ignoring her."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_2_2,"I don't like it when you push away someone who is worried about you \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_1,"We have to stop Liselotta. \n But for the sake of the children of Ceredo, what is the right thing to do?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_2,"The first thing to do is to stop the demon summoning ritual.\n It will be too late if something happens."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_3,"It's pathetic, but I don't think I can stop \n Liz on my own... \n Please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_1_1,"As an adult, I have a responsibility to stop Liselotta and the others who are \n trying to do something dangerous."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_1_2,"I don't think I can stop \n Liz by myself. \n Please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_3_1,"It's okay, Firo-kun.\n We'll figure something out!\n Hey! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_3_2,"Ah, thank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_4_1,"The tower you are told never to approach...\n There is definitely some junk in this!\n Guppupupu!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_1_1,"Liselotta really intends to begin \n the ritual. \n We don't know what dangers there may be."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_1_2,"We must somehow stop the \n demon summoning ritual!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_1,"A dream kingdom where you can live and play as much as you like...\n If such a country could really be created, \n how great would it be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_2,"However, I can't believe that demons exist and can conveniently \n grant your wishes."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_3,"Yes... There must be a reason why the adults told us to never go near Rinja Tower."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_3_1,"The amber jewel with a butterfly in it \n that the Queen obtained... \n Could it be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_3_2,"Ah! For now, \n we have to stop the demon summoning ritual. \n Let’s quickly return to Seredo town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_4_1,"I was expecting to find junk in the tower, but all I found was \n a shiny ball."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_4_2,"I have to go back to the town of Seredo and ask that familiar to take out all the \n junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_2_1,"A kingdom full of children without adults...\n At that age, it might seem like a dreamland\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_2_1,"Don't let Liselotta's \n wish to meet her parents be trampled upon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_2_2,"I don't want to turn kids into servants... \n I don't want those stupid people trying to create such a stupid country!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_5_1,"It's wrong to trick children and build a kingdom for your own desires!\n I will never let you go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_1_1,"I will not let the children of Seredo become servants of \n the devil!　"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_1_2,"Mr. {pc}!\n Hurry and return to the church on the hill!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_3_1,"I can't forgive the queens for being such a fool all this time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_3_2,"I won't lose to the devil who looks at everyone who is hurt\n and laughs\n again!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_1,"I can't believe I was fooled by my familiar...\n Considering her seemingly competent attitude, \n You're the Queen of Punk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_2,"Rather than becoming a servant of a demon, \n I would like you to work as my assistant!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_3,"Assistant... Anyway, \n Let's help the queens!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_1_1,"We can't fulfill the children's \n wishes, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_1_2,"As adults, we need to \n watch over our children."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_5_1,"I guess the children of Seredo town were fooled \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_5_2,"Then, I was told that \n the fact that the adults disappeared because of the failure of the summoning ritual was a lie...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_3_1,"Everyone. \n Let's go to the Dharma Temple!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_3_2,"I want to see \n what Filo-kun and the others are doing."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_4_1,"I'm not interested in temples! \n Everything is shiny and polished.\n It's not my shumi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_2_1,"It's a shame to be fooled by monsters...\n That's why we can't live in a country just for kids.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_2_2,"...It's hard when you don't have an adult to rely on \n in an emergency."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_3_1,"Someday, the honorary children will be able to eat snacks \n and they'll make it into a wonderful town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_3_2,"Those guys had more guts than I expected. \n It'll be okay...I'm sure."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_1_1,"Maybe the prayers we all prayed for didn't reach you... \n I feel like I can't do it all."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_2_1,"I thought \n maybe at the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_2_2,"Isn't that god-sama forgetting \n his job?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_4_1,"Isn't it true that you don't make the children's wishes come true?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_5_1,"The adults in town didn't come back...\n The positive attitude of the children \n is at least a relief."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_5_2,"Also, the \n amber jewel that Liselotta-san gave me... There's a butterfly inside \n I guess this is the butterfly Crows-san mentioned...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_2_1,"Even if you forget your name or your past, \n as long as you have the will to move forward, \n that's enough."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_4_1,"All the people, I don't even remember their names\n It's a nice country, even though they're all crap!\n I like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_3_1,"Everyone in the country \n said they had lost their memories. \n They even forgot their names..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_3_2,"Me...Before I went on the journey with {pc}, \n I didn't really like you, but \n I don't want to forget myself..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_5_1,"All the people have lost their memories...?\n I can't even imagine how difficult \n it must be to lead the people in such a state..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_1_1,"Even if there's something \n you don't understand about yourself... as long as you don't \n betray your current heart, you'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_2_1,"Did you get Seraph?\n I understand how you feel, but \n You are too reckless."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_2_2,"But I couldn't help but feel sorry for you \n and couldn't look at you. \n Thank you for helping me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_1,"I think \n it's more fun to show each other junk than to make monsters fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_2,"Aha! That looks interesting!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_3,"You're a very easy-to-understand guy. \n I liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_1,"The king of Arahagiro\n cared a lot about the people of the country\n and thought he was a nice person."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_2,"Sometimes monsters will understand if you talk to them, like the monster in Sui's tower."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_3,"Is that so!?\nThen, it wouldn't be strange if there were other monsters\n that could get along with people, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_4,"Yeah...!\n The atmosphere in the fighting arena was scary, but\n I'm glad I met Seraphy-san!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_5,"Hehe. Me too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_1,"Even though it's a monster, it doesn't feel good to make an execution a spectacle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_2,"Even though it's for the sake of the people who have lost their memories, \n Isn't there a better way?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_3,"There may be a clue \n in the rocks of Murud. \n So come with me! Please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_1,"I can't let \n a bunch of people flock to one girl just because there's something I don't like!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_2,"Thank you so much for earlier!\n I just can't forgive you for such a ridiculous thing\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_3,"I understand how you feel, but \n Don't be so reckless."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_4_1,"...What? Don't expect me to do something useful like \n reading the words on the tombstone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_3_1,"Hmm...\n There were a lot of demon users\n in this country."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_3_2,"I guess I lost my memory and forgot about that too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_1,"Hmm... Monster battle itself may be \n a traditional culture of \n Arahagiro Kingdom, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_2,"The show you saw just now didn't feel like a land where you face monsters on an equal footing \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_3,"Something doesn't make sense to me.\n Did losing my memory really mean that everything\n was forgotten?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_2_1,"A monster champion...\n I bet he was really strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_2_2,"...I wonder how Wang Sama was feeling when he came to such a place by himself \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_1_1,"A tomb created by a demon user for the monsters... \n The monsters here were loved, weren't they?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_4_1,"...Are you really helping someone? \n I'm just following \n to find junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_1,"He's wearing the same bracelet as Seraphy-san.\n Is that a killer panther?\n I'm sure they were good friends!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_2,"And I feel like if I see her again \n I'll be able to remember her. \n So could you help me find her?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_3,"Of course.\n Hey! Mr. {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_5_1,"If you don't have the heart to accept and forgive any evil monster, you can't become a true demon user...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_5_2,"You have to have the heart to accept and forgive, not only between magic users, but also between people."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_2_1,"That Seraphy guy can't use monsters... \n Before he lost his memory, \n Was he able to control monsters properly...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_1_1,"Is it a killer panther with a cross mark on its left eye?\n If it has such a noticeable feature, \n you'll be able to tell it apart right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_2_1,"...Looking for one monster in the jungle?\n Looks like it's going to be difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_1,"The monsters that appear in the Jaira jungle are really strong, aren't they? \n It's a little scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_2,"But, but! \n For the sake of Seraphy-san’s memory, \n I have to do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_3,"Thank you Fuura-chan!\n I'll do my best too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_1_1,"The \n killer panther you're looking for with the cross-scarred eyes may be \n deep in the jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_1_2,"We don't know what other monsters are out there, so let's be careful \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_1,"Searching for one monster in the jungle...\n Even though there is a cross mark as a landmark\n It seems difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_2,"However, if Seraphy-san's memory is restored, \n it may be a hint for other Arahagiro Kingdom people to regain their \n memories."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_3,"Ugh. It might be a bit of a big responsibility...\n But it reminds me to do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_1,"Kuppupupupu...!\n Ancient ruins hidden in the jungle!\n I have a feeling it's going to be some wonderful junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_2,"...The objective is the killer panther with a cross mark on his left eye\n, isn't it?\n I'll leave it behind if I take a detour."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_3,"Being left behind\n and being treated like junk...\n It's not that bad!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_3_1,"When I called you Chome, you seemed a little dissatisfied, but...\n Is that okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_3_2,"But I'm glad you found me safely!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_2_1,"This is a fine killer panther.\n This guy looks strong!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_1_1,"I'm glad I was able to meet my partner safely...\n I was also very nervous when Arold was kidnapped.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_1,"If you don't have the heart to accept and forgive \n no matter how brutal the monster is, \n you won't be able to become a true demon user..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_2,"As written on the stone monument on Murud's rocky mountain, \n Seraphi, as a true magician, communicated with Chome \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_3,"I hope that Seraphi-san's feelings will be conveyed to \n King Bermud and the others."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_4_1,"That killer panther called Chome\n seems smarter than Potsukon\n, but it's not to my liking."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_2_1,"Before the monsters hurt each other and die, let's hurry to \n the monster-only entrance east of \n Arahagiro!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_1_1,"I think it would be terrible to force \n monsters to fight each other until there is only one last one left."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_1_2,"We must stop such a stupid event \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_3_1,"It's terrible to make \n fight to the death just because it's a monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_3_2,"I came to tell you that humans and monsters can become friends!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_1,"Why did King Bermud, who was said to have come to the monsters' grave\n, do such a terrible thing...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_2,"Does it have something to do with people losing their memories?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_3,"I don't know, but...\n Anyway, we have to help the monsters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_4_1,"I'm sure \n there's good junk in places you can't normally go into! \n I'm going to the side entrance of the fighting arena!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_2_1,"I can't abandon someone I know is going to die \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_2_2,"As a monster, Chome probably thinks so too."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_1,"I wonder if they'll find out if I lie...? \n But I don't think someone like {pc} would lie \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_2,"You look like you're flat."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_3,"I...I didn't mean that!\n Mr. {pc}!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_5_1,"I'm reluctant to lie, but...\n I have no choice but to avoid casualties."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_1_1,"If Seraphy-san's strategy is successful, \n the monsters will also be saved."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_1_2,"...I can't allow you to lock me up \n in order to make you fight to the death."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_4_1,"Is the former Potsucon No. 2 capable of deceiving people?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_4_2,"If you say that, I don't think any of us \n would be able to lie well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_2_1,"Hey, Seraphy!\n All of a sudden, your life might be on the line\n What is that!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_2_2,"Sorry!\n More details later!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_1,"{pc}-sama! \n Let's go together with Seraphy-san to stop the king!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_2,"Thank you...! When you open the door near Ori's room where the monsters were captured, there is an elevator that takes you to the battle hall."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_3,"Bermud-san should be there now...\n Everyone please!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_5_1,"Seraphi-san \n It's definitely not a good idea to go alone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_5_2,"Uh...Yeah, sorry.\nBut I have to hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_1_1,"Seraphy-san, I see you remembered something.\n Since you've come this far, \n I'll be with you until the end!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_1_2,"So…\n Don’t be so reckless as to risk your life!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_4_1,"I couldn't believe I was fooled by the former Potsukon No. 2's clumsy acting.\n I really liked that soldier!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_2_1,"Wasn't King Bermud human? \n I can't believe he could change into the form of a monster like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_2_2,"Anyway, I'm worried about Seraphy. \n {pc}! Hurry up, \n I'm going to destroy King Bermud!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! Mr. Seraphy is missing!\n...Maybe he is trying to stop King Bermud by himself\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_3_2,"If that's the case, I need to help you quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_5_1,"That appearance of King Bermud...\n I felt a very deceptive power."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_5_2,"I can't leave Seraphi-san alone! \n Let's head to the battle hall of the fighting arena!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_1_1,"Mr. Seraphy, you have remembered \n yourself from the past. I am curious as to what happened \n, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_1_2,"The first thing we need to do now is stop King Bermud.\n Mr. Seraphy should be waiting for us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_4_1,"I can't believe that the monsters I let go\n are actually helping me...\n It's really nice to be so sloppy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_4_2,"Come on! \n I’ll go back to collect the floppy girl!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_2_1,"Seraphy thanked me, but \n I don't know if this was a good thing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_2_2,"If you have the will to become a king, \n think about protecting the monsters first...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_5_1,"When King Bermud took on the form of a monster, \n he said that it was the power he had accumulated from that person."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_5_2,"Who are they and why?\n There are so many things I don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_1_1,"I was able to cancel the survival deathmatch, but \n I couldn't save King Bermud..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_1_2,"Anyway, Seraphy was \n a hoimi slime..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_1,"Is Seraphy-san a hoimi slime?\n But it seems true that he is Chome's partner...\n Laguas-kun, do you understand?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_2,"Yeah, probably... \n However, it would be better to hear from Seraphy-san directly \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_3,"\n Seraphi-san is waiting for you at the stone monument of the demon charmer on Murud's Rock Mountain."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_4_1,"It's ridiculous \n to risk your life for revenge!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_4_2,"However, I wouldn't waste my life in the least for junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_2_1,"Seraphy and Calevan... huh?\n They say they're going on a trip too, so maybe we'll meet again somewhere."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_4_1,"Come on! We too \n will set out on a journey in search of new junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_3_1,"Seraphy-san and Chome...\n Ah, Kalevan-san... I see. \n As long as they're together, it'll be fine, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_1_1,"Mr. Karevan and King Bermud were \n brother disciples..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_1_2,"I'm sure they trained each other \n like Giganf and Arold..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_1,"Monsters turned into humans...\n Humans turned into monsters\n Mysterious events in this country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_2,"In the end, I didn't find out anything other than the fact that the war with demons was the cause."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_3,"But, with the bracelet that Seraphy-san gave me...\nIf I collect butterflies and go to the Kingdom of Gran Zedora, will I be able to learn anything?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_1,"Hey, hey, why was Mishua able to pass through \n without being stopped by the gatekeeper?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_2,"Who is Mishua...?\n I don't even know what the three butterflies mean\n And Crows just happened to show up..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_3,"I don’t understand it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_4_1,"Next up is the junk from the Kingdom of Granzedora! \n Guppupupupu... I'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_5_1,"...Mr. Crows seems to have known from the beginning that \n the gate would be passable."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_5_2,"That was like..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_3_1,"Got it!\n Now you can go to the Kingdom of Granzedora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_3_2,"But the three butterflies don't seem to be related...?\n I gave them to Mr. Crows, but \n he didn't use them for anything, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_1_1,"Finally, the Kingdom of Granzedora. \n Let's brace ourselves."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_2_1,"I don't mind Mishua going to Gran Zedora Castle, but have you told Laska?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_1_1,"Mishua-san, even after we parted \n, did you continue searching for your memories by yourself?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_4_1,"I also have a feeling that the little junk I haven't seen yet is waiting for me at Gran Zedora Castle!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_11_3_1,"Granzedora Castle is so big! \n Which castle is more magnificent among the five continents?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_11_3_2,"The quality of a country is not determined by the size or beauty of its castles.\n But this is certainly amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_1,"Mr. Mishua is a strange person. \n For some reason, I feel that you and \n {pc} are a little similar."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_2,"I can't believe the two of you look alike...\n Finally, you're starting to become a bit clumsy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_3,"What!? No, I’m not talking about looks…."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_3_1,"Huh? Huh? Huh? \n Why do the hero and Mishua-san have the same face \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_1,"Princess Anlucia and Mr. Mishua \n Both looked surprised."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_2,"Indeed, it was so similar that it was hard to believe that it was someone else's sora resemblance."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_3,"Ever since I came to Rendersia, \n it's really full of strange things."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_2_1,"...That's the Hero Princess!\n I was surprised to see the same face as Mishua...\n Ude certainly looks like she'll stand up."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_1_1,"Hero-sama and Mishua-san\n looked just like each other...\n Could they actually be twins?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_1,"I'm not interested in thrones, so why don't we just explore inside the castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_2,"Mr. Duston. \n What are you talking about all the way here? \n I'll go with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_3,"Mukya!!\n Don’t say things like Chili!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_3_1,"Mr. Hollow said that the princess of Gran Zedora was \n an awakened hero, right? \n What does that mean...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_3_2,"That old man, even if he makes silly jokes\n, he would never tell a lie like this.\n What's going on...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_5_1,"When Princess Anlucia heard from {pc} about \n the light of the Awakening of the Hero \n, it seemed like she was angry about something...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_2_1,"Hey, that's a different story.\n The hollow old man said that the light we saw was\n the light of the awakening of the hero, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_1_1,"The princess hasn't woken up yet...\n But back then, Giganf and Arold\n were definitely the light that saved us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_4_1,"I wish you could rent me a warehouse full of junk from your castle bedroom \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_4_2,"I don't think you can just borrow it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_3_1,"Wow...I wish I could have slept a little longer."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_5_1,"Mr. {pc}. You may still be sleepy, but \n Let's go to the throne room of Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_5_2,"The purpose of our journey is to help Princess Anlucia as a hero, even if she has not yet awakened."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_2_1,"It seems like \n the princess here liked us \n to be summoned in the morning."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_1_1,"Beds in castles are soft, aren't they?\n I was nervous at first, but I slept well."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_1_2,"It would be bad to keep the princess waiting, so let's get ready and go to the throne room."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_4_1,"You woke me up and called me out while I was sleeping comfortably...\n It's okay to treat me so poorly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_3_1,"Just because Mr. Mishua and Princess Anlucia look so similar, will my memories return if they are together?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_5_1,"I can't believe I would let Mishua accompany me on something as dangerous as subjugating a giant dragon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_5_2,"Does Princess Anlucia have any \n chance of winning?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_1,"Exterminating the giant red dragon...\n Just how strong is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_2,"Hyuza-san, no. \n We are Mishua-san’s \n bodyguards!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_3,"...I know."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_1_1,"Something seems suspicious, but...\n This is your chance to see what the princess is capable of!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_1_2,"If you are in danger, we will help you!\n That is also our mission!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_4_1,"It would be a waste to try to get it back when you have lost your memory and it is completely broken!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_3_1,"Mr. Mishua, \n I was surprised when you suddenly disappeared from Mersandi Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_3_2,"I'm sorry. I don't remember much either...\n But I feel like I really have to go to Gran Zedora Castle\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_5_1,"Now that I think about it, I still don't understand \n why another Mishua appeared in Mersandi Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_5_2,"But Mr. Mishua here also \n doesn't seem to know anything, so it might be best not to force him to ask."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_2_1,"If it's true, we shouldn't take someone who can't fight \n to a dangerous place, like where there are dragons..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_2_2,"But with us here, \n I won't let Mishua get a single scratch. \n Hey, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_1_1,"It's the princess's orders, so we \n will do our best to protect her, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_1_2,"Are you sure it’s okay to take me?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_1,"The giant red dragon of Zedra Cave...? \n As long as you keep up all the junk, \n I don't care if it's a dragon or anything!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_2,"By the way, Mr. Duston, what \n do you like about \n junk?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_3,"Of course it's useless! \n I'd be better off without it. If there's no use for it, \n It's the best!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_4,"Huh...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_5,"...Don't worry.\n We still don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_3_1,"Exterminating the giant red dragon...\n Princess Anlucia, are you okay?\n I hope you don't get hurt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_5_1,"The giant red dragon is deep inside Zedra Cave.\n Mishua is also there, so \n Proceed carefully."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_2_1,"I wonder how the princess will defeat \n the giant red dragon... \n This one is something to see."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_2_2,"When it comes to \n ability that can exterminate giant dragons... \n It seems certain that you are strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_1_1,"Looks like the princess went first.\n Let's make sure we protect Mishua \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_4_1,"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of junk the giant red dragon has!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_4_2,"It's called a giant dragon, so \n I'm sure it's a huge piece of junk that I wouldn't be able to find a place to display!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_2_1,"Hero Princess, your attitude has suddenly changed.\n Suddenly you're laughing out loud.\n What do you mean by losing half of your body?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_2_2,"I don't really understand, but \n I have no choice but to follow them!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_5_1,"...Princess Anlucia said \n that she would prepare for the ceremony."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_5_2,"Until the preparations are complete, Mr. Mishua must \n be locked up somewhere in Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_1_1,"Is Mishua originally part of the princess?\n If that's the case, it makes sense that they have the same face\n though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_1_2,"Anyway, I can't leave you alone like this! \n Let's follow!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_3_1,"Hey {pc}!\n Let’s go help Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_3_2,"The power of the hero, the half body of Princess Anlucia, etc.\n I was taken away without really understanding, but\n I can't leave you alone like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_4_1,"It would be outrageous to put together a broken girl who doesn't remember anything \n and a broken brave princess who can't awaken \n and make her useful!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_4_2,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\n I’ll get in your way!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_2_1,"That brave princess Sama...\n Are you planning to do something with Mishua?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_2_2,"I have to go help Mishua...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_1,"Even if Old Dime's grandson went missing, \n no one would question it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_2,"Is something going on in Mersandi Village that we don't know about, like when another Mishua appeared?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_3,"...It seems better to hurry."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_1_1,"After listening to Mr. Daime's story, \n it seems that the princess is involved in \n the disappearances in the castle town..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_1_2,"Mishua-san is in danger!\n Let’s go help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_3_1,"I can't believe that \n so many people who met Princess Anlucia are gone... \n I have to go help Mishua-san quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_3_2,"There's a secret passage in the Sea Breeze Cave north of Revule Road that you can enter with the key you got from Mr. Dime, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_4_1,"Secret passage!\n This guy definitely has junk!\n Let's hurry to the Sea Breeze Cave!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_2_1,"I was surprised when Crow's Yarrow suddenly appeared, but... there's no point in worrying about it. \n Now, let's hurry to Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_5_1,"Sea Breeze Cave... It's a secret passage, so \n we don't know what's inside. \n Proceed with caution."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_1_1,"I'm also curious about Mr. Crows, but \n Now we need to rescue Mr. Mishua first!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_1,"Mr. Crows, you didn't come to tell us something \n again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_2,"Right now, let's focus on getting through the secret passageway and helping \n Mishua."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_3,"Yeah. That’s right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_4_1,"Those Crows are surprisingly slow to follow us \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_4_2,"...Gmmmm? Could it be that \n you're after my junk!? \n I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_1_1,"Were those mages involved in \n King Bermud becoming a monster in the Arahagiro Kingdom?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_1_2,"I can't forgive that...\n!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_2_1,"That suspicious old man \n seems to have just disappeared! \n Let's go save Mishua now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_2_2,"Yeah!\n I’m worried about Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_5_1,"When King Bermud became a monster, \n Granzedora's soldiers rushed in, \n under the instructions of the mage earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_5_2,"Then, who is that person \n that King Bermud said saved \n power...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_3_1,"The experiment material is Mishua-san!?\n Before something happens to Mishua-san, let’s hurry up and help him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_4_1,"Where is the floppy girl?\n While you’re at it with all the junk, \n it’s okay to look for her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_2_1,"I left the task of restoring Mishua's memories to \n you. \n You shouldn't be selling oil here."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_4_1,"Former Potsucon No. 2! \n I pick up junk from \n the world of memories!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_3_1,"Mr. {pc}\n Do you think Mishua will be able to regain his memories?\n I will support you too, so please do your best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_5_1,"The three butterflies we collected had the role of restoring\n Mishua's memories..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_5_2,"When did Mr. Crows know \n this would happen...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_1_1,"The reason you were collecting butterflies was to \n restore Mishua's memories."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_1_2,"Only one person can \n enter the world of memories, so it's frustrating to wait, but...I'll leave it to \n {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_2_1,"Hey, hey! That's Mishua...\n No, she's an awakened princess!? \n I totally misunderstood you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_2_2,"Yeah...\n But I feel like Mishua's face, or rather \n, her kind side hasn't changed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_1,"If this isn't the real Gran Zedora, \n can I take the junk I found?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_2,"No!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_3,"Agyaba! \n I wasn't supposed to help you find a hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_3_1,"Huh!?\n Is Mishua the real hero princess?\n Then what about the other Princess Anlucia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_3_2,"Even Mr. Crows didn't seem to understand, so \n I'll have no choice but to meet the other Princess Anlucia and ask her \n directly."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_5_1,"I also felt something strange about Mishua \n, but I was surprised to find out that he was a real hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_5_2,"But first, we need to escape from this castle.\n If you follow the secret passage in the opposite direction from when you came, you should be able to get out."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_1_1,"I never thought Mishua was \n the real Princess Anlucia...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_1_2,"But that light saved us\n It is the same light as that time...\n That is the light of the awakening of the hero!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_2_1,"A guy who hurts people like that can't be called a hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_2_2,"Let's fight together with the awakened princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_3_1,"Even Mr. Dime, who was so kind to me... I can't forgive him! \n There's no way a person like that could become a real hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_3_2,"Yeah. You can't become a hero just by acquiring the power. Don't become one. \n I'll definitely stop you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_5_1,"Those words of the fake hero princess...\n I was born to become a hero...?\n And what is the vortex of creation...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_5_2,"There are still a lot of things we don't understand, but \n it's our mission to help the brave princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_1_1,"The magical power of creation...!?\n Is that princess seriously planning to become\n a true hero...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_1_2,"Let's head to Dharma Temple \n with the Hero Princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_4_1,"I don't understand \n wanting to become stronger by stealing someone else's power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_4_2,"You're a rare kindred spirit, man.\n...I'll never forgive them."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_6_1,"To avenge Dime-san's regrets \n In order not to take any more people's lives \n I must absolutely stop the other me."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_6_2,"Let's look for the path to the \n Creation Vortex, which is located between the rituals of the Dharma Temple!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_2_1,"Hey! {pc}!\n You've been looking pale for a while!?\n Are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_1_1,"What's wrong?\n You seem to be acting different than usual..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_1_2,"If you need anything, feel free to let me know. \n I'm strong enough to protect {pc} too."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_3_1,"Dear {pc}\n After passing through the journey door of the Dharma Temple\n I don't feel well... Are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_3_2,"If there is anything I can do for you, feel free to tell me!\n Because we are friends!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_5_1,"Are you really confident \n to tell us where you are and \n have us follow you? Or..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_1,"What kind of thing is Sausée?\n I wonder what kind of thing it is. \n Isn't it some useless junk?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_2,"I heard it has tremendous power, so \n I don't think it's the kind of junk that Mr. Duston is expecting."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_3,"Mukyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_6_1,"The whirlpool of creation... So \n I must stop what the other me is trying to do!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_2_1,"I'm surprised...\n Everything since I came to the Rendersia continent is something made up by the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_2_2,"Well...\n The people I've met so far...\n I don't think it's fake at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_3_1,"Laska-kun, Firo-kun, Seraphy-san \n All the people in the towns and villages I have been to so far \n Were they all created by the Great Demon King...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_5_1,"False Rendersia...\n That's what the indescribable discomfort I've been feeling so far has been."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_5_2,"How powerful is it to create an entire continent, including the people who live on it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_1_1,"Those words of the fake Princess Anlucia...\n Even though she was abandoned by the Great Demon King,\n she tried to fight against that fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_1_2,"Maybe she is also a victim of the Great Demon King\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_4_1,"Is this Rendersia a fake...?\nAre you saying it was all a piece of crap?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_4_2,"Then, the person who created it, the Great Demon King, likes \n ridiculous junk!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_1,"Great Demon Lord Madesagora...\n Created a false Rendersia\n and toyed with the people living there."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_2,"...There are some things that bother me, but \n I have to return to the real Gran Zedora first."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_3,"Let's wait for Mr. Crows to arrive in the room where I was previously locked up on the 3rd floor of the west tower of Gran Zedora Castle \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_1,"The real Mersandi Cered\n Arahagiro..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_2,"Aren't the people I've met so far \n not in this world?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_3,"I feel kind of lonely..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_2_1,"Look for any anomalies...\n What you're saying is too vague.\n I wonder if we can handle it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_2_2,"I know \n that the Great Demon King's bastard is plotting something, but... it seems like \n he's stuck his neck out."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_4_1,"Next time, I'll find some real junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_4_2,"I wonder if there are both fake and real things in the junk...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_1_1,"The evil hand of the Great Demon King \n is reaching out to the true Rendersia as well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_1_2,"We need to look for \n anomalies in order to prevent something \n that would make someone sad even in this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_5_1,"What kind of connection is there between this true Rendersia and \n the false Rendersia... \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_5_2,"If you go to the true world of Melsandi\n Ceredo Arahagiro\n you might find out something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_6_1,"{pc}... Thanks to you guys \n I was able to see my father and mother again. \n Thank you so much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_6_2,"And as a friend who travels with me, \n I look forward to your continued support."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_3_1,"My brother...\n I don't have any siblings, but\n I wonder what he's like...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_3_2,"……?\n Suddenly you were staring at me, did you need something from me?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_2_1,"When you regain your memory, you must have missed your brother.\n Let's go to his room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_1,"Okay then \n the junk in the princess’s room…"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_2,"It's no good \n to raid the lady's room!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_3,"Ugggggggg...\n That's not funny!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_1_1,"I lost my memory all this time\n and was in a false world...\n Let's let you go to your brother's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_5_1,"...We have lost far too many people to the Great Demon King and Hades. \n Prince Thoma is one of them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_6_1,"My brother's room is on the third floor of the east tower \n of Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_6_2,"In the fake Gran Zedora Castle\n Same room as the one you guys stayed in."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1,"I heard that I can go back and forth between two worlds! \n I'll be able to meet everyone from Children's Country, Raska-kun \n, Seraphy-san, and the others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1,"How do the Crows know so \n everything?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_2,"I understand that you seem to be on our side, but \n knowing so much about everything feels a little creepy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1,"Sigh... You really like collecting useful things. \n I'm embarrassed to have you as my assistant!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1,"I had no idea that those stone towers that were everywhere had such a role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2,"But now we can \n travel between the two worlds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1,"What is Mr. Crows supposed to do...? \n I'm sure the time will come when his purpose overlaps with our journey \n again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1,"{pc}\n Thank you for stopping by my brother's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_2,"Don't lose the Brave Stone. \n You may have to go back and forth between the two worlds in the future."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1_melsr,"Even though the village looks the same, \n it's strange that no one knows \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1_melsr,"It looks almost the same as the village of Melsandi in the false world\n, but...\n Something doesn't feel right."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2_melsr,"Look carefully. There are no dead trees in this village, and none of the houses are damaged."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_3_melsr,"It's true...\n Prince Laguas You remembered it well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1_melsr,"There's also a statue of \n Zankrone in Melsandi village here."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_2_melsr,"...Does that mean \n Zankrone is here as well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_3_melsr,"If the true Rendersia also has him, there's no way that Lucienda wouldn't know about it, but...\n I've never heard of such a thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_4_melsr,"What do you mean?\n I don't understand at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1_melsr,"The villages look similar, but \n the people who live there seem to be different."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_2_melsr,"Aren't Mishua-san, Laska-san \n the village chief, and Granny Kope \n not there?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1_melsr,"I don't care if it's real or not! \n It's just whether or not it's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1_melsr,"It's true that it's Melsandi Village, but \n I... it's not the village where Mishua spent time. \n It feels very strange."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_2_1,"Is it \n abnormal that the wheat was stolen by monsters?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_2_2,"I don't really understand, but \n depending on the situation, maybe we should treat it as an anomaly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_1,"Stealing someone else's things \n Some monsters are in trouble. \n What would they use if they stole flour?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_2,"I wonder if monsters also bake bread...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_3,"I just can't imagine..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_3_1,"Airi-chan, are you feeling unwell?\n I hope you get better soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_5_1,"Helping Airi-san might be a clue to \n investigating the strange situation in this area."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_4_1,"Stealing the bread before it's baked\n You're an impatient monster. \n I don't dislike that kind of thing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_6_1,"The wheat from Melsandi Village...\n It reminds me of the fluffy bread that Grandma Kope baked."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_6_2,"Now, let's exterminate the monsters that stole it and get back the \n wheat!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_2_1,"Now that we've recovered the wheat from the monsters, let's quickly grind it into flour at the watermill."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_1_1,"It's beautiful wheat. \n I wonder if the false Mersandi village had just as \n beautiful wheat."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_3_1,"Now we can get all the wheat back?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_5_1,"Stealing the harvested wheat \n is an absolutely terrible monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_4_1,"The guy who came up with the idea of ​​turning this grass into bread and eating it deliciously \n is a talented guy who is not good at it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_6_1,"The next step is to turn the wheat into flour. \n Let me use the \n flour mill at Meln Watermill Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_2_1,"I'm starting to want to eat bread made with this flour too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_1_1,"I feel nostalgic for going to the false world of Meln Watermill Village\n to pick up Grandma Kope\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_1_2,"Let's all clean up the stream...\n I still can't believe \n that Rendersia was fake."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_3_1,"With this flour, I'm sure \n you can make really delicious bread!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_5_1,"It takes a lot of effort to make even one loaf of bread.\n I learned a lot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_4_1,"The waterwheels in this world are \n crappy, aren't they? \n That's a shame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_6_1,"Now that we've finished grinding the flour, let's go give the wheat to Airi-san."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_2_1,"The smell of bread is making me hungry.\n Let's eat something later."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_1_1,"It smells good...\n That bread looks very delicious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_3_1,"Wow...\n Airi-chan's baked bread\n Looks very delicious..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_5_1,"Now all you have to do is deliver this bread to \n Mr. Lapet in the village square."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_5_2,"If \n no major changes have occurred in Mersandi Village, \n that's all good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_4_1,"If the bread was hard and bitter, \n I would happily eat it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_6_1,"Grandma Kope's bread was \n soft and very delicious, but \n Airi's bread looks delicious too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_3_1,"The mysterious traveler \n who was with Laska-kun... \n Could it be us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_3_2,"But...but that can't be true, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_1_1,"It's called a hand monster\n It's Mr. Zankrone's signature line\n It was the same turmoil we experienced."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_2_1,"What's going on?! \n The events in that village \n were all made up!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_2_2,"Are you saying that we actually \n experienced the fictional world of stories...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_5_1,"What happened in that village...\n Did they turn our experiences into a picture-story show?\n Were we there in the picture-story show...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_5_2,"Does this mean something is wrong?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_4_1,"What we've seen becomes a picture-story show?\n This is quite an experience!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_6_1,"Grandpa Lapet's picture story show...\n What on earth does that mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_3_1,"The mysterious traveler from the fairy tale and \n {pc} have the same name... \n Well then..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_3_2,"But we \n have never met \n Airi's grandfather, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_1_1,"The story of our experience has been turned into a fairy tale, and there is a sequel to it...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_1_2,"I'm really curious, but \n it's a sad ending..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_1,"Sad ending? \n We \n should have defeated that monster, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_2,"After we get rid of the ghosts, \n something scary might happen again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_3,"If that's the case, then \n we have to defeat the monster again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_5_1,"If our experience is a \n fairy tale of this world, then what is the sad ending \n that lies ahead?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_4_1,"I was forced to stay at the Big Room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_4_2,"Both Mersandi villages \n like to bully me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_6_1,"The sad ending of the \n fairy tale in which Laska and the others appear..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_6_2,"There may be some connection with \n the other Mersandi village. \n Let's ask Airi again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_1,"Airi-chan, you \n chased a big rabbit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_2,"You said you wouldn't be able to go out much.\n I wonder if you'll be okay... I'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_3,"{pc}-sama, let's go find \n Airi-chan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_1_1,"I'm worried that Airi is gone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_1_2,"If a giant rabbit is involved, \n we need to find it quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_2_1,"Giant rabbits? \n Could it be those \n that we met in the fake Melsandi?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_5_1,"Maybe it's a big rabbit...?\n No, now let's look for Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_4_1,"A giant rabbit? That's too bad\n It doesn't seem useful!\n I'll go find it right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_6_1,"I'm worried about Airi. \n Let's go find her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_6_2,"Where did you go? \n I wonder if anyone in the village saw you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_3_1,"The ones Airi was chasing were \n the bad guys after all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_3_2,"Mr. {pc}! \n If we don't hurry, Airi-chan will be bullied like a numb jellyfish!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_1_1,"Those rabbits \n Even in this world \n I think they're going to do something unpleasant..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_1_2,"Let's protect Airi and the rabbits before they \n meet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_2_1,"It's the bad rabbit...\n After all, they were the ones who were bullying the numb jellyfish\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_2_2,"I don't know why you're in this world, but \n Airi might be in danger. \n We need to find her soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_5_1,"The Komorebi Square in this world is also \n to the west of Melsandi Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_5_2,"But in that world, \n there were no caves. \n Let's be careful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_4_1,"A giant rabbit with no cuteness!\n A square with a cave that is almost pale!\n That's great! You can expect this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_6_1,"There was no \n Rabbani Hole in the hidden plaza of the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_6_2,"In two worlds, things that are the same and things that are different...\n For what purpose...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}\n Airi, I'm glad you're safe!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_3_2,"But he went outside by himself, so \n I have to chase him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_1_1,"Those rabbits \n are not the monsters that were playing pranks \n at the water mill before..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_1_2,"If the fake world is a fairy tale, then \n why are they even in this world...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_2_1,"Are those rabbits \n the mischievous rabbits from fairy tales? \n What do you mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_5_1,"Airi also \n said that it was a rabbit that appeared in fairy tales, and after all \n that time at the watermill..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_5_2,"How did you get \n from the fake world without using a Brave Stone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_4_1,"Oh! You really were there!\n Snack time is more important\n What a pompous person!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_4_2,"I'm getting more and more interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_6_1,"I can't believe that the rabbits from back then \n are even in this world...\n What's going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_1,"I can't believe I was able to reunite with Mr. Zankrone...\n But Mr. Zankrone seemed to be doing well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_2,"But... what? \n Isn't Mr. Zankrone a \n character from a fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_3,"In the false world of Melsandi, did you meet \n the real Zancrone-sama?\n...Ugh, I'm getting confused."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_1_1,"He knew about us\n He is definitely the real Mr. Zancrone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_1_2,"Is it unusual for characters from fairy tales to appear\n and that this is happening in this village?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_2_1,"I'm worried about Airi, but if you leave \n to Zancrone, she'll be fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_2_2,"Still, I was surprised to meet \n Zankrone in this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_5_1,"I can't believe that a mischievous rabbit and Mr. Zankrone have come to our world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_5_2,"Isn't the false Melsandi just created to resemble a fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_4_1,"There's no need for a hero who can carry one person even though he's so small!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_4_2,"That’s amazing….\n As expected from the hero of Mersandi Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_1,"...Zankrone-san \n You've forgotten about me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_2,"The people of Melsandi Village seem to have forgotten about \n Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_3,"But we remember it!\n Hey, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_4,"...Thank you everyone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_3_1,"Airi-chan, are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_1_1,"Airi-san, \n I think you overdid yourself a bit when chasing the rabbit. \n I hope you get better soon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_2_1,"I guess Airi fell asleep..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_2_2,"He looked sickly to begin with. \n I guess he used all his strength chasing \n the rabbits..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_5_1,"Did Mr. Zankrone go somewhere after \n delivering Mr. Airi?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_5_2,"It was the same in the fake world, but \n it's truly a rare occurrence."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_4_1,"Mukya!!\n I ended up staying at the Big Room again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_4_2,"I can't believe I'm such an important customer\n What a crappy inn!\n...I've reconsidered it just a little!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_6_1,"I'm worried about Airi. \n Have you felt any better \n since then?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_3_1,"They said they needed \n jam and butter to catch the rabbit! \n It looks delicious spread on bread."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_1_1,"The rabbits who \n lured Mr. Zankrone into this world... \n This might give us some hints."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_2_1,"I need to stop the rabbits and get them to talk \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_5_1,"It's heartwarming to hear that rabbits' favorite foods are jam and butter.\nIt's like a fairy tale."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_5_2,"Those naughty rabbits aren't what I'd call \n heartwarming, though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_4_1,"Those crappy rabbits \n Even though they're rabbits, they like jam and butter... \n They're smelling even better!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_6_1,"The Mr. Zancrone we know is \n the \n hero of fairy tales, after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_6_2,"But what does \n mean that their personalities are slightly different?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_1,"Mr. Zancrone's body was \n dismembered by a witch..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_2,"Then, the dismembered bodies were attacking the people of \n Mersandi Village..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_3,"That's so sad! \n {pc}, let's help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_1_1,"There must be a key to solving the mystery in the continuation of Airi's fairy tale \n! \n Let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_2_1,"A witch who will tear apart heroes...\n You have to be careful.\n {pc}! Don't let your guard down!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_5_1,"She dismembers the bodies of the village's heroes\n and turns them into monsters that attack the village...\n What a terrifying witch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_1,"My precious little rabbit got sucked in!\n I hate being a hero because of this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_2,"But it was originally \n Mr. Zankrone's ear, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_3,"Then, does that mean that hero was \n a piece of crap!? \n That’s great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_6_1,"Let's go back to Airi-san.\n Maybe we can learn something about the witch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_3_1,"Airi-chan...\n Before her life ends, she wants to save everyone in the village..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_3_2,"Dear {pc}!\n Let's defeat the evil witch and\n make Airi feel at ease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_1_1,"A witch brings \n eternal night to Mersandi village... \n What does that mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_1_2,"In any case, it looks like we have no choice but to find the witch\n.\n Let's go! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_2_1,"I don't really understand the false world, the true world, etc. \n It's such a complicated thing \n, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_2_2,"I can't forgive anyone who would cause Airi or Laska to suffer \n! \n {pc}! I'll destroy the witch!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_5_1,"When will the witch come and \n how will she try to destroy the village...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_5_2,"Is it about time for Airi to \n calm down and be able to talk \n about the witch in the fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_4_1,"It looks like the witch has a lot of junk!\n So when will she come?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_6_1,"We can't leave Mersandi village...\n and Airi-san alone like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_1,"Dear {pc}.\n I'm glad you found out the witch's weakness!\n But why is the chicken the weak point?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_2,"Is it because I don't like cries... or something like that?\n I also get a little surprised when someone cries loudly near me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_3,"Huh~ Mr. Laguas doesn't like the chicken's \n cries. I think he likes it when he says, Morning has come! \n.''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_4,"No, no! I'm just saying that \n will be surprised if you hear a loud voice nearby!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_1_1,"The witch's weakness is chickens...\n I don't know if it's true, but \n I'll bet on that for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_2_1,"Chicken is a weak point...\n That witch might be surprisingly weak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_2_2,"...It's surprising that the witch who wants to destroy Mersandi Village is afraid of \n chickens."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_5_1,"A witch's weakness...!\n As Airi said, \n It may be the hope that can change the fate of destruction!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_4_1,"Chicken is your weakness\n That's quite a prank!\n I kind of like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_6_1,"Now that I know the witch's weakness, \n I will not let you destroy \n Mersandi village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_6_2,"Let's go \n {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_3_1,"I can't believe the chicken isn't my weak point... \n Melsandi village will be destroyed! \n Mr. {pc}, what should we do!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_1_1,"I don't know what the witch will do to dismember Mr. Zancrone's body\n and have him attack the villagers... \n I don't know what the witch will do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_1_2,"Hurry up and get back to the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_2_1,"I didn't expect Zankrone to be blown away so far... \n After all, that witch can't be defeated easily."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_5_1,"Mr. Zancrone's...crime?\n Did something happen between him and that witch\n before?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_4_1,"I'm disappointed in that witch \n who is stronger than the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_4_2,"Oh no!\n This is not the time to say things like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_6_1,"I can't believe you told us about the fear of destruction...\n But it's true that there's nothing we can do other than talk to Airi.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_6_2,"Let's go back to Airi-san. \n If possible, \n I didn't want to talk about this with my current girlfriend, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_3_1,"I'll do my best!\n I have to show Airi-chan some hope!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_3_2,"First of all...what should we do? \n In addition to Airi-chan, maybe we should ask someone who knows a lot about fairy tales \n about witches?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_1_1,"Anlucia-san is right.\n If you don't have hope, you can't fight \n the cruel fate..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_1_2,"We will absolutely defeat the witch.\n To Airi... To show \n hope to the people of this village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_2_1,"No one is blaming you for misunderstanding your weaknesses...\n Airi, don't push yourself into a corner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_2_2,"For the sake of Airi and the others in the village who are depressed, \n we have no choice but to defeat that witch!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_5_1,"Let's all bring \n hope back to Airi and Mersandi Village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_4_1,"If it were me, just looking at junk would give me energy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_6_1,"{pc}\n Lend me your power too.\n I want to show Airi-san hope."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_3_1,"The jewel Mr. Lapet gave me \n has a powerful shine..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_3_2,"If you show me the jewelry, Airi-chan might feel better \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_1_1,"It's the \n jewel that was also found in Melsandi in the false world. In this world, \n Lapet-san has it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_1_2,"I wonder if Airi will cheer up \n when she sees the jewel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_2_1,"In the fairy tale, Zancrone loses to the witch, and the continuation \n has not been written..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_2_2,"Does that mean Zankrone lost to \n the witch just like the fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_5_1,"This red gem that Mr. Lapet gave me...\n I received it from the numb jellyfish in the fake world.\n Is it the real great crimson gem?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_1,"I'm not interested in this kind of jewelry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_2,"If Mr. Duston says that, then \n is it real after all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_3,"Moky!!\n Don’t use me for your convenience!\n Please use me for your inconvenience!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_6_1,"The jewel I received from Mr. Lapet...\n It looks kind of familiar. \n Maybe it's a real soul crystal?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_3_1,"{pc}! We're in trouble!\n We have to go help Airi-chan quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_1_1,"...What?! Mr. {pc}!\n Hurry up and go to the witch!\n Rescue Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_2_1,"You witch...I can't forgive you!!\n Oi {pc}!!\n Let's quickly head to the witch's mansion!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_5_1,"The night banquet hall in the Witch's Forest, which extends from the Rhône Forest.\n I'm sure that's what the witch said."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_5_2,"It's some sort of trick to go out of your way to call me out...\n No, now is not the time to \n say something like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_4_1,"Witch's mansion! \n Looks like there's some ridiculous junk \n there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_4_2,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\n I'll hurry up and head there!\n Garakuta-chan is waiting for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_6_1,"Witch Greetzel...\n How despicable...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_6_2,"{pc}!\n Let's go help Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_3_1,"Awesome! As expected of a hero, Mr. Zankrone!\n Airi-chan was safe too\n I'm really glad!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_1_1,"Hero Zankrone...\n He was truly worthy of being called a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_1_2,"If Mr. Zancrone is here, \n I think we can live in peace in \n either Melsandi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_2_1,"Huh! As expected of a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_2_2,"With Zankrone's encouragement, Airi also seems to have found a hope and a dream to live \n, so it's a happy ending for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_5_1,"I'm so glad that Airi is feeling better\n...\n I'm feeling better too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_4_1,"I don't know if you're okay even if you don't have a heart\n Are you good or are you just a piece of crap?\n I don't know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_4_2,"I'm starting to get interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_6_1,"It's unfortunate that we lost the witch, but \n Airi was safe, so \n I can feel at ease for now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_6_2,"All that's left is to send Airi to \n Mersandi Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_3_1,"Airi-chan, you're feeling much better, \n Lapet-san looks happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_3_2,"The continuation of Airi's story \n What kind of story will it be? \n I'm looking forward to it, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_1_1,"The story of the hero Mr. Zankrone will continue \n with Airi taking over."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_1_2,"I'm sure it will become this village's \n great hope and continue forever...\n That's a wonderful thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_2_1,"Airi's guy is feeling much better.\n The kid needs to be like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_2_2,"Then let's quickly defeat the Great Demon King and \n make sure this peace lasts forever. \n Hey {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_5_1,"Mr. Zankrone encouraged Mr. Airi's heart \n, and the false village of Melsandi will surely be saved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_5_2,"With courage and hope\n I will act without hesitation for the people I need to protect...\n I must become like him...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_4_1,"If I keep looking for strange things in the world, will I be able to find \n a place full of junk like that witch's mansion?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_4_2,"Now let’s move on!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_6_1,"If Airi continues to write stories of hope, \n even if the witch tries to do something again, \n the hero Zankrone will surely help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_6_2,"He was truly a hero.\n I must continue to do my best to be worthy of being a hero.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1_serer,"From what I see, it looks exactly like another town of Seredo \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_2_serer,"However, it seems that there are adults in this town as well.\n What's the difference...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1_serer,"A girl who looks like the queen of the false town of Seredo...\n Just like Lady Anlucia and the Demon Hero\n Are they just different people with similar faces?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1_serer,"Mr. Duston has noticed how \n that girl looks like \n Liselotta."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2_serer,"It feels like all you can see is junk, but \n surprisingly, you may actually be able to see people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_3_serer,"Mukya!? You just said \n me!? Stop it! \n I’m getting goosebumps!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_4_serer,"Yes, yes…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_5_serer,"Aha…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1_serer,"There's a kid here who looks like \n Queen Sama from Seredo over there. \n It seems like the people in town are no different from over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1_serer,"Even though you look so much like the Queen of the False Town, \n I can't believe you don't notice me at all...\n You're perfect to be my assistant!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_2_serer,"No! We're not Mr. Duston's assistants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1_serer,"The town of Seredo, at the foot of the Dharma Temple...\n But the people seem to be in a dark mood. \n Let's take a look around to see if anything is wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_5_1,"The church on the hill is reduced to rubble...\n However, the other church seems to be safe. \n Is there a meaning behind this difference?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_3_1,"The Queen's Church\n would have been destroyed in this world...\n But it's a different world, so it doesn't matter, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_3_2,"Oh, don't think it doesn't matter..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_1_1,"There are a lot of things I don't understand, but\n First, let's go get the shiny book\n back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_2_1,"It's hard for an old drow man to clean up the pile of rubble all by himself.\n Isn't there anyone who can help?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_1,"Leave the shiny books \n to the former Potsucon No. 2 \n I want to dig under the rubble too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_2,"I'm sure some rare junk will come out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_3,"...Hey {pc}.\n Is Mr. Duston always like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_6_1,"It's important to investigate incidents, but \n we can't ignore people who are in trouble. \n Let's get back the books stolen by the monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_5_1,"This sparkling book...\n Is it someone's diary...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_3_1,"It's a very sparkling \n wonderful book... \n I wonder who the owner is...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_1_1,"This is a very nice book. \n Let's take it to Mr. Drow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_2_1,"A book that sparkles like this...\n Maybe it's no wonder that monsters want it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_4_1,"You wouldn't want a musty, tattered book \n than a shiny book like that? \n It's even better if you can't read it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_6_1,"It might be someone's important item, so \n Let's quickly deliver the book."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_5_1,"This book is written by the mayor of Seredo...\n No, let's stop digging into it too much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_3_1,"I wonder what \n was written in the shiny book..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_3_2,"I’m really curious…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_1_1,"A book that other people shouldn't read casually...\n It doesn't seem like it's just a book."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_1_2,"The owner of the book may be in trouble. \n Let's go to the mayor's house on the west side of town."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_2_1,"Does the shiny book belong to \n the town mayor?\n...No way."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_4_1,"I don't care who owns such a shiny book!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_4_2,"Rather than that, if you're going to the mayor's house, \n I'd like you to show me if there's any good junk there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_6_1,"Let's deliver the book to the mayor's house. \n Also, he might be able to tell us if there's anything unusual.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_5_1,"The relationship between the two worlds... \n But what on earth is that diary left behind by Liserotta \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_3_1,"If you're the mayor, you don't have to be so angry with Lucoria."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_3_2,"Remembering me and my father from the past...\n It's a bit disgusting."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_1_1,"What do you mean by Lisellotta's belongings...\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_1_2,"Lucoria-san... you told the mayor that you wanted us to visit your sister's\n grave...\n...Is there a grave?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_1,"That mayor is so cold to Lucoria. \n What is he so busy that he has to yell at the kid?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_2,"...Let's hurry out of this house and talk to the old drow man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_3,"You might know \n about Queen Sama's belongings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_4_1,"What's wrong with a child being shamed and useless?\n What's wrong with that?\n I want the guy in Chile to follow his example!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_4_2,"Oh, you're saying something a little Matomo-like \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_1,"……That kind of thing happened in the fake town of Seredo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_2,"A child who is thought to be dead here is alive over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_3,"Why on earth did the Great Demon King create \n the false town of Seredo?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_5_1,"When I defeated the Demon Hero, I thought I had solved \n the problem of the false world, but... \n The mystery is only getting deeper."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_1,"I was aware of what Lucoria said \n but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_2,"The Queen is dead..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_3,"I'm shocked to hear this again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_1,"The children in Seredo town are \n dead, and Lucoria is \n the only child..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_2,"In the town of Ceredo in the false world, \n Lisellotta, Firo, and others \n everyone seemed to be doing well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_3,"The Great Demon King created \n those children based on the children who died...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_2_1,"The Seredo kids in the fake world were already dead...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_4_1,"Even though he's dead, he's still alive \n Is he a piece of crap or what? \n I don't even understand!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_6_1,"Just as the Great Demon King created the Demon Heroes, \n he created the dead children as false residents of Seredo...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_6_2,"That's why the adults and \n Lucoria-san weren't in that town.\n...It's a sad story, though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_1_1,"I wonder if Mr. Lucoria is \n aware of the world beyond \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_1_2,"Isn't it because you noticed that you entrusted us with \n an important letter?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_3_1,"Mr. Lucoria knew \n about the honorary child."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_3_2,"I wonder if he used \n even with the Queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_5_1,"There are a lot of things I'm curious about, but \n Let's deliver the letter to Liselotta. \n I'm sure you'll find out something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_5_2,"There was \n the Stone Tower of Courage just outside the town of Seredo, so \n you can go back and forth between the two worlds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_2_1,"Well, we could give \n the letter directly to \n Liselotta..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_2_2,"Now that I know he's dead, \n how should I tell you... \n I'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_4_1,"I'm a dishonorable adult, so \n I'll leave the useful work of delivering letters to \n Honorary Child, former Potsucon No. 2."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_4_2,"The reason I'm going with you is \n to check if there's any junk I overlooked!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_6_1,"I wonder how Lucoria-san found out about {pc} and the others...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_6_2,"The diary I gave you was dug out from under the rubble of \n the church."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_1_1,"I wonder what Liselotta will think when she reads \n the letter from Lucoria..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_1_2,"I don't know what is written, but I'm sure the Queen will understand \n the feelings contained in the letter."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_3_1,"Queen...\n You were surprised to hear that we had died..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_3_2,"It's normal to be surprised when \n suddenly hears about your own death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_5_1,"It seems that \n the monster's lie that \n the adults disappeared due to the failure of Liselotta's ritual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_2_1,"That Lisellotta guy... \n When he heard that they had died, \n he was angry instead of sad."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_2_2,"It doesn't seem like you're holding back from crying just because it's in front of us.\n I wonder if that's what you really mean."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_4_1,"Looks like there aren't any \n notable junks anymore in the town of Seredo, which is only made up of children."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_4_2,"If you're going to create a fake world, \n I wish you'd put more junk away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_6_1,"True Rendarsia and false Rendarsia...\n Even if you suddenly heard such a story, \n there's no way you would believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_6_2,"Anyway, the letter has been delivered, so let's go back to Lucoria-san."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_1_1,"As expected, all the children I met in the town of \n Seredo in the false Rendersia were dead..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_1_2,"But we were the only ones who could see \n those kids..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_3_1,"The diary was an important book that connected \n Lucoria to the dead queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_3_2,"Dear {pc}, \n I'm glad you found \n your diary among the rubble."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_5_1,"I thought \n that the two worlds were more than just similar, but to think they were connected like that through \n a diary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_2_1,"All of the kids in Seredo over there are dead..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_4_1,"Not only was that diary shiny, but it was also useful... \n I'm glad you delivered it so quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_1,"A connection with your deceased sister... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_2,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_3,"It's okay for me. Thanks to \n {pc}, I was able to say \n my final farewell to Mr. Thomas..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_1_1,"Here's the wool...I've only heard \n that it's used for tailoring, but I wonder what \n you're asking the tool shop for?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_3_1,"It's high-quality wool...\n It looks really warm. \n Dear {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_5_1,"Are you in such a hurry to ask \n us, even though we've only met once?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_2_1,"...I don't like it, but \n I'm the old man of Lucoria. \n I'll do at least a favor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_4_1,"High-quality wool!\n Just hearing something like that gives me chills!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_4_2,"It looks warm though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_6_1,"Mayor-san \n Are you going to make warm clothes?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_1_1,"I'm sure the dead children don't hold grudges against adults.\n But what about the vision of the church and the children's voices earlier...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_3_1,"Dear {pc}...\n I saw a broken church.\n I wasn't wrong, right...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_5_1,"That vision of the collapsed church... \n The church that was in that place in the false town of Seredo \n was also destroyed, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_5_2,"Did that \n appear as an illusion in this world? \n If so, why...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_2_1,"...A vision of a destroyed church and \n the voice of a kid who was supposed to be dead... The town of Ceredo is filled with \n strange things that don't happen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_4_1,"I thought the church had collapsed, but \n it was fixed right away... \n It was quite an experience!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_6_1,"The children who were supposed to be dead are alive in another town of Seredo... \n Even if I say that, you won't believe me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_6_2,"Can you at least believe that I don't hold a grudge against adults?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_1_1,"You shouldn't \n worry the weak-minded. \n It's better to keep quiet about the church."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_3_1,"If you \n tell the townspeople about the church, \n you might suffer even more than you are now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_5_1,"No matter what happens, Mayor Blato always thinks about the residents.\n Mayor Blato's attitude is admirable.\n I want to emulate him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_2_1,"About the vision of the church...\n The mayor told the townspeople to keep quiet.\n I understand how you feel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_2_2,"If the adults panic any more, \n it will be difficult to keep them together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_4_1,"A ghost who just laughs...\n That's what I want as an assistant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_6_1,"I wonder if this is also the devil's plan to show people who have lost their families \n illusions and make them suffer \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_1,"The people of the town are also important, so \n I understand why you want to hold a meeting, but \n I want you to see more of Lucoria."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_2,"I wonder why the mayor doesn't \n value \n the surviving Lucoria..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_3,"I feel sorry for Liselotta if that parent and child keep getting away from each other. \n I want to do something about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_1,"The mayor is always angry at \n Lucoria..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_2,"The mayor also has a responsibility to protect the people of the town, so \n he might be putting his daughter on the back burner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_3,"I kind of understand that, but...\n I feel sorry for Lucoria, who cares about the queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_5_1,"The Incense of Peace was dropped by the \n Elder Dragon in the Llana Desolation Zone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_5_2,"Since we don't know the cause of the illusion, the best thing we can do now is \n to make you feel at least a little bit at ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_2_1,"They are still praying for the adults who are unlikely to come back \n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_4_1,"I'm not interested in the comforting incense, but \n if it makes you feel sick, \n I'll take it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_6_1,"When I think about Mr. Lucoria and the \n parents who lost their children, \n my breasts hurt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_6_2,"I know \n how painful and sad it is to lose a loved one."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_1_1,"You've obtained the Incense of Peace.\n Let's go to the Mayor of Seredo's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_3_1,"If there is a scent of peace, will everyone in Seredo town be able to stay away from their anxiety a little?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_5_1,"A scent of peace....\n It's a mysterious scent that I can't describe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_2_1,"I got the incense of peace.\n Isn't it something important to use at meetings?\n I need to deliver it to the mayor of Seredo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_4_1,"Is this the scent of peace?\n It's such an addictive smell!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_6_1,"It would be great if the people of Seredo could feel at ease with this scent of peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_3_1,"The mayor seems to be very busy... Mr. \n {pc}! Let's deliver the incense of peace \n directly to the meeting place!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_1_1,"As per the memo, shall we go to the meeting hall and deliver the incense of peace?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_5_1,"Mayor Burat is very busy.\n I hope you have time to talk to Mr. Lucoria after the meeting is over.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_1,"Have you already started preparing for the meeting?\n You're an impatient mayor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_2,"That's how strong your feelings for everyone in the town are \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_3,"In front of everyone in town \n First of all, it's my daughter..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_1,"The mayor is rough with people! \n This makes me \n look like he's being useful!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_2,"That's what makes Mr. Duston angry after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_3,"...Hey {pc}.\n Mr. Duston\n Are you okay with things like this...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_6_1,"The meeting place was located west of the water source, passing through an underground passage and proceeding along \n the cliff."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_6_2,"{pc}.\n Let's go deliver the scent of peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_3_1,"Mr. Lucoria \n didn't lie..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_3_2,"The mayor believes in the stranger \n medium..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_1_1,"That medium... \n calling the ghosts of dead children \n evil spirits..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_1_2,"I can't forgive \n saying things that demean children who want to meet adults!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_5_1,"After burning the soothing incense at the gathering, \n I felt a little dazed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_5_2,"Maybe we were used by that man named Sadak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_1,"...The mayor should listen to \n Lucoria."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_2,"He knows \n the kids the most...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_3,"You want the mayor to believe, not just us \n, right?...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_4_1,"When I was at a gathering, I smelled a strange odor, and \n everyone looked as if they were potcon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_4_2,"I shouldn't have given you such good junk \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_6_1,"It's terrible that none of the children were jealous and \n turned into demons!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_6_2,"I think you should be careful \n with that medium named Sadak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_3_1,"It's terrible! If the diary is lost, the \n connection between Lucoria and the Queen will be lost!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_3_2,"Dear {pc}! \n Let me help you find your diary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_1_1,"Is there any clue about that diary?\n First of all, let's listen to the people of Seredo town \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_5_1,"Out of the four of us, the most suspicious one is...\n No, we shouldn't make any assumptions.\n First, let's listen to their stories."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_2_1,"I didn't say I was looking for the diary...\n Well, it was a pretty bad diary, so \n If someone in town saw it, they might remember it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_4_1,"I can't believe I ended up wandering around over and over again looking for the diary... Not just the former Potsucon #2, but all of them \n have joined the board!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_4_2,"...I can't deny it, but that diary is \n an important item related to the incident in Seredo town. \n Let's look for it carefully."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_6_1,"The missing diary is an important connection between Lucoria and \n your sister, so \n I want to find it somehow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_6_2,"When I think about what happened if I lost Toma-niisama's belongings, I can't imagine it being someone else's problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_3_1,"How dare you steal the diary that the Queen and Ms. Lucoria \n treasure!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_3_2,"Mr. {pc}! For the sake of both of us, \n we will definitely get it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_1_1,"As expected, that medium took \n Lisellotta's diary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_1_2,"I can't believe you would take away \n the precious diary that is the bond between Liselotta and Lucoria... \n Let's go to Rinja Tower quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_5_1,"Is it because \n that diary makes it \n difficult to pretend that the children have become demons?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_5_2,"Anyway, let's go to Rinja Tower and get \n the diary back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_2_1,"I can't believe a medium would steal \n something that belongs to a kid... \n That guy is suspicious after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_4_1,"This diary is often stolen. \n What's so good about such a shiny book?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_6_1,"I can't let Lucoria-san go alone.\n Let's hurry to Rinja Tower too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_1,"My precious diary...\n It was burnt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_2,"But! I couldn't protect the diary, but if you're a townie, there's still time!\n I won't let that medium do what he wants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_3,"Dear {pc}!\n Let's hurry and return to Seredo town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_1_1,"The purpose of the medium is to erode this side's \n Seredo with false Seredo..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_1_2,"I can't forgive you for \n deceiving everyone in town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_5_1,"I'm also curious about the \n masked person who was instructing Sadak... \n First, let's prevent the erosion of the false world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_2_1,"I can't forgive that Sadak bastard! \n Let's go to Seredo town quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_4_1,"What will happen if our world is invaded by a false world \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_4_2,"This world is going to be ruined too... \n Is that what you mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_6_1,"Who is that black masked man...?\n No, not right now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_6_2,"{pc}!\n Let's hurry back to Seredo town to stop Sadak's plan\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_3_1,"Even though we defeated Sadak, \n the erosion still hasn't stopped...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_1_1,"For now, let's go to the chapel of \n Dharma Temple with the townspeople."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_5_1,"As Lucoria said, \n Let's go to the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_5_2,"As people who know the two towns of Seredo\n, we have to witness it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_2_1,"Even though we defeated the Sadak bastard, \n it's not over yet!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_4_1,"A monster who is getting in the way of a girl!\n And a girl who is a girl and a girl who is a girl!\n It's a nice town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_4_2,"I agree with you about it being a clumsy monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_6_1,"Thanks to Lucoria-san, we were able to prevent \n Sadak's plan."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_6_2,"But as Lucoria-san said, \n if the erosion is not over yet... \n Let's go to the Dharma Temple quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_3_1,"Even though the mayor is clumsy,\n he actually cares about the Queen and Lisellotta."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_3_2,"...I also want to meet \n my father."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_5_1,"I think it was good that we were finally able to express our feelings to each other \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_5_2,"...But it's an invasion by a false world.\n It seems like the Great Demon King isn't satisfied with just creating his own world.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_1_1,"The children's prayers have finally been answered. \n We will be separated again, but \n I'm really glad we were able to say goodbye."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_1_2,"Mr. Lucoria also received a \n doll from Ms. Liserotta... \n Yeah, it's okay now, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_2_1,"Reuniting dead kids with adults...\n Lucoria is a big deal."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_1,"I can't believe I only let you see me for a short time \n After all, that guy called Kami-Sama is a total idiot!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_2,"If it's true, I won't be able to meet the dead guy. \n Even just a little bit would be nice."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_3,"Hmph! I guess that's what it is.\n...Well, I like the idea of ​​a clumsy god, \n though!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_6_1,"I'm sure the people of this town will be okay. \n Finally, I was able to \n convey my important feelings..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_2_1,"Is this the true Kingdom of Arahagiro?\n Compared to the false world of Arahagiro, \n it doesn't seem to have changed much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_1,"I have met King Moonis of the Arahagiro Kingdom before\n, but do you know anything about the incident?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_2,"Now that I think about it, even in the fake world, \n the Grand Zedora Kingdom and the Arahagiro Kingdom seem to have had \n contact."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_3,"However, the purpose was to use \n King Bermud and the others as experimental materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_4,"To abuse the bond between two countries in such a distorted way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_5,"I don't know what the Great Demon King is planning, but \n I will absolutely stop it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_4_1,"It would be great if there was also a ruin here in Arahagiro that was blessed with \n junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_3_1,"The wind here in Arahagiro is also very hot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_5_1,"In either world\n It's hot in the Arahagiro Kingdom...\n I hope we can find a clue soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_1_1,"It doesn't seem like \n the battles between monsters are really exciting here at Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_1,"You said something like, 'Let that pot drain the water...\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_2,"You look weak, but \n it's kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_3,"It looks like there's something in the pot.\n Should I bring you some water?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_6_1,"I feel like I heard that voice from that pressure point\n somewhere...\nI'm sure it's just my imagination."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_4_1,"A talking pot would be useful, but \n It's just a bunch of crap that just wants water! \n That's just how I like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_3_1,"It was kind of a creepy pressure point, but...\n Is it okay to do as you say?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_3_2,"...But the voice inside the pressure point \n seemed to be in a lot of pain."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_5_1,"It was a suspicious pot, but\n I can't just leave it alone.\n Let's deliver water from the oasis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_1_1,"Drink the water from the \n oasis in front of the monster fighting arena...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_1_2,"I don't know what's inside the pot, but \n I can't leave it alone, so let's go to the monster fighting arena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_2_1,"The guy in the pot\n was making a pretty painful voice\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_2_2,"{pc}. Let's go ahead and bring you \n some water."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_6_1,"I got the water as you asked, but \n I wonder what's in that pot?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_6_2,"The voice I heard from the pressure point...\n I feel like I heard it somewhere...\n Hmm, I wonder where it was?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_4_1,"That stupid pressure point that wants water...\n Isn't it a bad idea to just take it home?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_3_1,"I wonder what \n is inside the pressure points...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_3_2,"I didn't see any bad signs. \n Take some water from the oasis and \n I hope you find out who it is...''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_5_1,"I feel bad about using the precious oasis water for \n an unknown black mass, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_5_2,"It may be a clue to investigating the abnormalities in the Arahagiro Kingdom \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_1_1,"Let's deliver \n the water from the oasis to the talking pot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_1_2,"I'm really \n curious about what's inside the pressure points..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_2_1,"...The monster called itself King Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_2_2,"I went back to my country...\n Is it okay for me to go back like that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_1,"I met King Moonis when I was still small."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_2,"Even though we are the same king, I still remember thinking that \n you and my father are very different."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_3,"I feel like that monster's personality and voice\n resembled King Moonis at that time\n, but... I wonder if it's real?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_4_1,"Come on! Hurry up and follow that seaweed \n!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_1,"There is a king inside the pot \n The king is a seaweed monster...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_2,"That seaweed monster king \n said he was going back to the castle!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_3,"{pc}, can I leave you alone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_5_1,"Hello...I'm glad to see that you didn't dry up like that and recovered\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_1_1,"If such a big seaweed monster went to \n the castle, wouldn't it cause a big fuss...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_1_2,"I'm a little worried. \n Let's go after you, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_2_1,"The monster the minister is talking about is \n the one who calls himself King Sama\n, isn't he talking about wakame...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_2_2,"If it's that wakame monster, \n it's only natural that there will be an uproar..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_6_1,"Did that seaweed monster \n just enter the Arahagiro Kingdom and get captured?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_6_2,"I feel like the King Moonis I know would do \n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_1,"I'm sure it's that seaweed! \n It's a nice chunk that won't disappoint!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_2,"Former Potsucon No. 2! \n I'm so jealous that you like me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_3,"Come on! \n From the side entrance of the fighting arena \n I’ll go see Wakame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_4,"Hey {pc}...\n Isn't Duston-san's enthusiasm \n a bit unique...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_3_1,"I'm just calling out {pc}'s name, so \n the seaweed monster king \n must have been in a lot of trouble..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_5_1,"The one calling {pc} is \n that seaweed king, \n I'm glad he hasn't been exterminated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_1_1,"If you're calling Mr. {pc}'s name, \n it's definitely the monster that came out of that pressure point."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_1,"If the wakame monster is King Sama, \n I don't think anyone would believe me in my monster form..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_2,"If you don't get the King Shaku back, \n King, he won't be able to get out of the cage!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_3,"Even if it's a monster, the country needs a king.\n Shall we go get the king back?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_6_1,"Indeed, the real King Moonis also \n had a golden talisman.\n Then, after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_6_2,"{pc}. \n Let's go to the south of the Arahagiro region and retrieve \n the king shank."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_4_1,"If I say I'm going to take it, \n could you please let that wakame king out of \n the cage?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_4_2,"...Doesn't that mean you'll be taking \n with us on our journey?\n Please give me a break from that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_3_1,"If Wakame remains as it is now, no one will believe that he is the king\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_3_2,"I still can’t believe it either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_5_1,"I knew about the king, so I guess he really is the king of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_5_2,"Maybe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_1_1,"You seem to be in trouble because you can't prove that you're the king\n, so let's get the king's crown back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_1_2,"Regardless of whether he's really the king or not, \n I feel a little guilty about keeping him locked up like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_2_1,"You've got the Kingfisher back.\nThen let's take it to that seaweed.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_6_1,"Let's deliver the golden talisman to \n King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_6_2,"Even though he looks like that, \n I believe he is the real King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_4_1,"It's a shiny, shiny piece of wood! \n That doesn't suit Wakame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_3_1,"If you have a king, everyone will believe that you are the king, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_3_2,"Hurry up and deliver \n to the basement of the fighting arena!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_5_1,"Well, it's great that we got the king shank back, but \n will you now believe that \n is the real King Moonis?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_1_1,"I hope the people of Arahagiro Kingdom will believe that \n I got it back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_1,"I'm glad that you believed that wakame was the Kingfisher.\n...I guess he didn't need the Kingfisher."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_2,"I wish I could tell my subordinate's secret\n and have him believe me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_3,"It means that King Moonis watches his subjects closely.\nIn a sense, I think it is an ideal relationship of trust."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_6_1,"He was the real King Moonis after all. \n {pc} Thank you for believing in me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_4_1,"That seaweed... \n If you didn't believe that he was the king, \n I would have wanted to take him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_4_2,"But in a country where seaweed is king, \n it’s quite nice!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_3_1,"Even if there wasn't a king, \n with the advice from Laguas-kun, \n you could have believed me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_3_2,"Either way, we'll still need the Kingfisher\n in the future...\n There's meaning in getting it back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_5_1,"I'm glad that the ministers and soldier commanders \n believed that I was the real King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_5_2,"If you weren't interested in your subjects, \n you might have remained in the cage forever."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_1_1,"I feel like the story went \n in a strange direction, but... \n It was really King Moonis, wasn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_1_2,"The king is now back, so I'm sure the ministers and soldiers are happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_2_1,"There are \n people like that Wakame King who have been turned into monsters and are suffering \n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_2_2,"I want to find the missing people as soon as possible and bring them home."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_6_1,"Turning captured people into monsters...\n What is the Great Demon King planning?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_4_1,"I thought it was a rare piece of crap, but \n I was surprised to find that he is a splendid king... \n I'm a little disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_3_1,"Let's cooperate with King Moonis so that all the soldiers who were transformed into monsters can \n quickly return to normal.\n Let's cooperate with King Moonis!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_5_1,"King Moonis cares \n for his vassals."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_5_2,"In order to become a fine king, \n I must follow your example."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_1_1,"A human who has been transformed into a monster...\n That's a false world.\n It overlaps with what I heard from Mr. Seraphy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_1,"Is it \n Kudus Spring deep in the Gyra jungle...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_2,"Even though I'm the King Sama, \n it feels strange to be walking around with someone who looks like a monster, but...\n Now that I've accepted you, I'll protect you properly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_3,"Hyohoho!\n You're a reliable cool guy!\n Thank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_1,"When I saw King Moonis' face \n, he looked kind and had a charming aura. \n I hope he can return to his normal state soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_2,"I guess it's fine even if I can't go back.\n I like the seaweed face you have now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_3,"Yeah...?\n Well, I don't think that's possible\n, but... Hey {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_1,"Are you going to turn the precious wakame back into a human? \n It’s such a waste!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_2,"I've just gotten used to this body, but if I remain a monster, I'll have trouble managing national affairs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_3,"Isn’t that good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_4,"What...?\n You have some interesting friends with you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_1,"Are you going to escort the king \n to the Kudus spring in the Gyra jungle...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_2,"Can I protect it properly?\n I'm nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_3,"Everyone is here and Fuura is strong enough. \n So it's okay."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_5_1,"Is it a holy spring that can remove the curse of change...?\n I'm glad it's recorded in ancient documents."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_5_2,"It's all thanks to the minister, Caboose. \n He writes cold love letters with poems, but \n he's good at his job."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_1,"In order for the king to return to his normal form as soon as possible, \n let us escort him \n to the Fountain of Kudus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_2,"What a dependable \n young lady. \n Please help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_3,"Mayu-san is the daughter of the \n village king of Rangao village. By the way, \n Fuura-san is also the daughter of the Azlan lord."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_4,"If you say that, Laguas-kun is not \n the prince of Megistris. \n Lady Anlucia is also a princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_5,"Hoho! Surprisingly, you guys are full of boys and girls.\n Hmm! That's as good as it gets!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_1,"Just by soaking in the Kudus spring \n you can easily return to your original form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_2,"...she didn't look much \n different though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_3,"The feel of his beard and the way it looked \n wasn't much different than when he was wakame..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_6_1,"I'm glad that King Moonis has returned to his original form. \n I hope the other people who were turned into monsters can also be found."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_4_1,"It's a pity that Wakame has turned back into a human, but could you please give me some junk as a thank you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_4_2,"Former Potsukon No. 2! \n Quickly, I'll go to the former Wakame King to get my thanks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_3_1,"The king returned to normal at the Fountain of Kudus, but \n it seems like he hasn't changed much...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_3_2,"What did you think, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_5_1,"Even after King Moonis returned to his human form, \n his atmosphere didn't change much. \n Not only his appearance, but also his brightness..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_5_2,"Even if you are transformed into a monster, \n you can still maintain your happy personality...\n Perhaps that is one of your qualities as a king."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_1_1,"King Moonis has returned to his original form, so \n he can finally appear in front of the people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_1_2,"Now, let's go to the \n throne room of the true Arahagiro Kingdom. \n King Moonis should be waiting for you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_3_1,"I hope the missing \n soldiers like King Moonis can be reunited."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_2_1,"I guess the missing guys are having a hard time in \n monster form, just like \n King Sama..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_6_1,"Do you have any more information \n about the missing soldiers?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_6_2,"If I meet King Moonis again, \n I might be able to ask him something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_4_1,"Soldiers and demon users who have been turned into monsters... \n Mugugu...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_4_2,"Well, it doesn't matter! \n Rather than that, let's look for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_5_1,"King Moonis is a very considerate person. \n I guess that's why you want to support him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_1_1,"We've found a way to get back to normal.\n Let's help \n find the missing person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_3_1,"The monster with the cross-shaped scar on its left eye is...\n Mr. Kalevan, the killer panther, who is with Mr. Seraphy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_3_2,"Dear {pc}! \n Let's go to the false world of Arahagiro Kingdom! \n Let's go meet Seraphy and the others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_1,"Kalevan the Demon Wizard...I think \n is the name of the killer panther who is with Seraphi when he was \n a human."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_2,"I think you should tell \n Seraphy-san what you heard from King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_3,"I have no choice but to go to Arahagiro over there and meet \n Seraphy and the others."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_1,"Everyone seems to have something in mind\n about Mr. Calevan.\n Could you tell me too?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_2,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_3,"...Yes. \n Something like that happened in the fake Arahagiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_4,"Let's meet \n Seraphy and the others who are said to be in the fake Arahagiro Kingdom and find out \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_4_1,"Karevan...?\n If you're not a piece of crap, I'm not interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_5_1,"It's a monster with a cross mark on its left eye.\nHis name is Kalevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_5_2,"I don't think it has anything to do with the events of the fake Arahagiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_1_1,"When I hear Maleika-san's story, \n I want to meet \n-san Kalevan as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_1_2,"I feel like \n the same person I was when Arold was gone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}! I will help \n Mr. Calevan meet his family as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_2_1,"Are you going to \n Stone Tower of Courage in front of Arahagiro Kingdom? \n Let's go quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_2_2,"We need to bring Seraphi and the others back to the true world as soon as possible. \n Kalevan's family is waiting for their return."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_6_1,"The \n Brave Stone will be useful in bringing Karevan and the others back to \n the true Arahagiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_6_2,"Now, let's quickly go to the \n Stone Tower of Courage in front of the false Kingdom of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_4_1,"There are all kinds of junk lying around near the Arahagiro Kingdom.\n I like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_5_1,"The only thing left to do is take Karevan back to \n the true Kingdom of Arahagiro and \n lift the curse."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_5_2,"Now that I think about it, Seraphy-san was also \n originally a hoimi slime. \n Will Seraphy-san’s curse be broken as well?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_1_1,"I want to let your wife and children meet\n Mr. Kaleven as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_1_2,"Let's go to \n Stone Tower of Courage in front of the false Kingdom of Arahagiro!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_3_1,"There's a monster that stole Mr. Kalevan's cameo\n It's called a demon's lair... \n It's got a scary name..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_2_1,"Is it a demon's lair...\n Hey, there are some monsters with some bones\n, don't you think?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_1,"Even with the power of Bravestone, \n I can't bring Mr. Karevan and the others back to the true world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_2,"If Mr. Crows was here at a time like this, \n he might have told me something, but \n I don't even know where he is..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_3,"Right now, the first thing to do is to get \n Kalevan-san's cameo back and \n make Mareika-san feel at ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_4_1,"A demon's lair! \n Lots of useless junk \n That sounds like a name!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_4_2,"Come on! Let’s go to \n the devil’s lair to look for junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_5_1,"You may get into a \n fight with the demon who stole your cameo. \n Be careful and go to the demon's lair."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_1_1,"I think \n your family's worries will lessen a little if you give them Kalevan-san's cameo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_1_2,"Even if Kalevan can't go home, \n his family needs to be reassured."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_3_1,"The Sweets Troll who stole Kalevan's cameo is a fashionable person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_3_2,"Now that you mention it, I think there is something we can learn from when it comes to fashion."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_2_1,"...What kind of person is that sweets troll \n going on a date with...\n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_1,"It was a strange monster..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_2,"Ah, instead of that, let's deliver \n the cameo to Maleika."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_3,"I think it must be very unsettling to not know if your loved one is alive or not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_4_1,"It's not good to assume that just because of the name \n that there is some wonderful junk in the lair of evil spirits..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_4_2,"I learned a lot too….\n A lot of things…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_5_1,"Let's go back to King Moonis once to deliver the cameo\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_1_1,"If we receive Mr. Kalevan's message, \n your family can continue to wait with faith."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_1_2,"You promised to come back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_3_1,"Even if I give you a cameo and a message, \n will not be able to replace \n Mr. Calevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_3_2,"Let's lend you our strength so that Kalevan-san can come back soon!\n Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_5_1,"King Moonis still seems to have \n something in mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_5_2,"Let's listen to the story later. \n It might be a clue to bring Mr. Calevan home.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_2_1,"I'm glad I was able to give you a cameo...\n If possible, I'd like to bring him back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_6_1,"I'm glad Malayka-san feels safe.\n It's because we believe in each other even though we're apart."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_4_1,"I believe \n that I can meet some wonderful junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_1_1,"I hope Mr. Kalevan and his family can be reunited \n soon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_3_1,"You did it! As King Moonis said, \n if Naseem's Cave is connected, \n the Kalevans can return to their own world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_3_2,"Hurry up and let Seraphy and the others know \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_5_1,"Bringing Mr. Calevan and his friends back to their home world is \n a role only those of us who can freely travel between these two worlds can do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_5_2,"It's almost \n until Mr. Kalevan can \n live with his family."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_2_1,"It looks like Seraphi and the others can finally return to their own world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_2_2,"Now Mr. Calevan can meet \n his family. That's good..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_6_1,"The two worlds may be connected in \n the Cave of Naseem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_6_2,"In that case, it makes sense that Mr. Kalevan and others \n who are residents of the true world are now in the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_1,"I don't know if the two worlds are connected\n convenient or inconvenient\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_2,"Well, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing\n, but...I'm glad there's a possibility of bringing Mr. Calevan back\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_3,"Mukya!? Oh, stop it!\n It’s like I’m Oriko-san to share the same opinion as you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_4,"Eh!?\n Excuse me for that...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_1_1,"If the true world and the false world \n Naseem's Cave are connected, \n it seems worth a try."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_1_2,"Let's go to the false world of Arahagiro to meet Seraphy and the others once again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_3_1,"Until Mr. Calevan and Mr. Seraphy return to \n their own world \n I'm sure it will be soon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_5_1,"The Seraphis have headed to \n the Cave of Naseem. Let's hurry too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_5_2,"The place where the two worlds are connected is probably in a place \n that is difficult to find. \n Look for it carefully."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_1,"There was a sweets troll \n in that cave. Is there a secret...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_2,"I'm sure it's filled with secret junk\n!\n I'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_3,"...That's really all there is to the old man. \n Well, \n I can't say that he doesn't have any junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_6_1,"If the demons who kidnapped Karevan and the others used \n Naseem's Cave to move, \n we need to be careful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_6_2,"Be careful {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_4_1,"I also thought Naseem's Cave \n was still suspicious. \n I won't go back until I find the junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_1_1,"The way for Kalevan to meet his family is now open. \n Now let's go to Naseem's Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_3_1,"Mr. Seraphy...\n I wonder why you didn't return to \n your own world with Mr. Calevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_5_1,"King Munis, who was investigating the Cave of True Naseem, should have found Kalevan."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_5_2,"Let's go see King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_2_1,"Why would Seraphy do something like that...\n I might never be able to see Kalevan again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_2_2,"The fact that he was going to send only Calevan back...\n That he would remain in the false world...\n Does that mean he had his own determination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_6_1,"The monsters closed the teleportation gate...\n They said it was a mission from Demon Marshal Zeldrad."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_6_2,"Demon Marshal Zeldorado... Thoma-nii-sama's Kataki! \n As long as I know where he is, then I'm sure...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_4_1,"Even though I couldn't read, I studied \n and was able to write a letter... \n I'm disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_4_2,"But I'm sure Mr. Calevan would be happy if he knew \n. \n Hey {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_1_1,"Seraphi-san, why...\n Didn't you want to go back to \n your original world with Mr. Calevan...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_2_1,"Kalevan will be lonely, but \n Seraphi's will and determination are \n strong..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_2_2,"Let's help \n as much as we can."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_3_1,"Mr. Seraphi had a strong will and \n was prepared to go a different path from \n Mr. Calevan."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_3_2,"Ah. You can't protect everyone half-heartedly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_5_1,"Family is a good thing.\n I'm really glad that Mr. Calevan was reunited with his family\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_1,"The Great Demon King...\n And the demons..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_2,"Not only did he take the life of Touma-niisama, but he also did terrible things to \n the people of Arahagiro Kingdom..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_3,"I don't know what you're planning, but \n I won't let you love me any more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_1,"I had high hopes for the Hoimi slime girl, but \n she has become so useful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_2,"It suits you to live happily while protecting Arahagiro over there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_3,"...Mr. Duston is really not honest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_1,"Mr. Seraphy... \n You sent Mr. Calevan back to \n his own world without telling him how you felt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_2,"I made this choice \n thinking about the monsters and people left behind by Mr. Karevan and the fake Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_3,"If Seraphy is in trouble, \n we will \n help her instead!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_2_1,"It seems that the Pendulum of Fate has enough power \n. \n I have to go back to the castle and report to Sage Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! \n Let's go report the results of the investigation of the incident to Lucienda-sama!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_5_1,"It seems that the pendulum of fate has gained power after investigating the abnormalities in the three regions."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_5_2,"I was able to change Melsandi Cered Arahagiro's \n fate... \n Does that mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_6_1,"Of course I remember registering my room in Lulastone, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_6_2,"I'm sure I'll have to go back \n to Gran Zedora Castle many times from now on to report to Lucienda, so please help me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_4_1,"What is that, that pendulum of fate?\n A stone that has the power to help others.\n Don't let it get near me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_1,"Melsandi Village, Seredo Town\n and Arahagiro Kingdom.\n The survey of the three areas has been completed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_2,"When I think back, the true world and the false world...\nI feel like they were very intricately intertwined."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_3,"In any case, let's report our investigation to \n Lucienda-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_2_1,"The enamel old man is so \n elusive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_3_1,"Does Enamel-sama like traveling too?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_3_2,"Perhaps you are lending your wisdom to various places as you travel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_5_1,"Is this where Mr. Hollow is?\n I remember..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_5_2,"The Landon Mountains during the decisive battle with Hades Nergel\n The port town of Lendor that I met at the ship management office... \n It seems like neither is the case right now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_6_1,"I have met Hollow-sama several times as well, but...\n I don't know where she is right now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_6_2,"Do you have any idea where {pc} is?\n For example... the place where you first met..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_4_1,"Sage Hollow...?\n Ah! You say something incomprehensible about that railroad track of destiny..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_4_2,"I like weirdos like that, but \n I failed to see that he was an excellent person who was useful to the world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_1_1,"As Lucienda-sama says,\n Eureka-sama has been visiting various places\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_1_2,"Why don't you first figure out where they are and start looking for them from there?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_2_1,"If that ogre sage Sama is asking you to \n prepare materials for research \n sooner..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_2_2,"Mr. Enamel \n is also busy with various tasks. \n Let us collect purifying herbs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_1,"Lord Hollow, perhaps you forgot about the \n research that \n Lucienda-sama asked you to do...''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_2,"I can't believe you forgot such an important request\n That's quite a prank!\n There's so much to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_3,"...I don't think I'd be happy if I received such compliments."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_1,"I'm glad that the Grand Titus is now able to travel\n to the true Kingdom of Grand Zedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_2,"This will reduce the number of people who wander into the false Rendersia without knowing anything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_3,"As expected of a wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_6_1,"For a wise man, Enamel-sama\n is a bit light-hearted, or rather\n doesn't he seem like a goofball?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_6_2,"But I love you. The only one who calls me \n Anlucia-chan is \n Holo-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_4_1,"I guess that wise old man\n is a bit of an idiot after all, isn’t he?\n I’d be happier that way though!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_1_1,"If we don't receive the results of Hollow-sama's research, \n we won't be able to report to Lucienda-sama either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_1_2,"Mr. {pc}. Let's collect the purifying herbs and give them to \n Hollow-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_2_1,"I'll quickly give the purification herb to \n Enameled Old Man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_3_1,"I wonder what kind of research the purification herbs we collected will be useful for \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_5_1,"Research using purifying herbs...\n Considering the name of the material, \n Is it a drug that can erase curses?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_5_2,"Since it was a request from the wise Lucienda, \n I have no doubt that this research will be useful to the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_6_1,"Now you can deliver the purifying herbs to \n Holo-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_6_2,"Will I be able to see you again if I get on the Ark of the Earth?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_1,"Cleansing herbs.\n If it were me, I would rather use something like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_2,"I want the herb of filth... maybe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_3,"No, if you're an old man, it's a muddy herb.\n...I don't know if such a thing really exists."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_4,"If someone reads ahead of what I want to say like that...\n It's okay, it seems like it's useless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_1_1,"That Hollow-sama \n seemed to be in more trouble than usual.\n Let's hurry and give her the purifying herbs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_2_1,"I hear about the research results of the enamel old man...\n Since it's about that old man, \n I'm worried that I might accidentally fail."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_3_1,"I wonder what kind of research \n Lord Luchenda asked Holo-sama to do...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_5_1,"I'm curious about Mr. Hollow's research results, but \n I can't secretly look at them, so \n I'll deliver them to Mr. Lucienda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_6_1,"I was a little worried because it seems that Mr. Hollow is always being asked by Ms. Luchenda to do difficult research\n, but I'm relieved now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_6_2,"The only thing left to do is hand over the results of Hollow-sama's research to \n Lucienda-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_4_1,"That wise old man \n may be excellent, but \n I can't hate him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_4_2,"It has an indescribable clunky smell, just like you, the former Potsucon No. 2.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_1_1,"I have to bring important research results to \n Lucienda-sama. \n But I wonder what kind of research it is..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_1,"Why is that guy named Milt so aggressive towards \n Anlucia...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_2,"It's okay, Huza-san.\n For Milt-san, I...\n Yeah, it can't be helped..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_3,"...Hmm. Well, if you don't feel comfortable asking, \n don't force yourself to ask. But don't forget that we are \n your allies."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_4,"...Thank you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_3_1,"Enamel-sama’s research results were amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_3_2,"If you can eat cold food with the same \n taste as freshly prepared \n, I think a lot of people will be happy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_5_1,"That's how the wise men conduct \n research every day to make people's lives better."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_5_2,"...By the way, Milt-san's attitude. \n Even if you have strong expectations for Princess Anlucia, \n I think it's a little too harsh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_1,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_2,"Toma-niisama...I......"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_3,"...Ah {pc}. I, the hero, \n should have done my best, but I'm sorry. \n Let's continue investigating Rendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_1,"I don't like that guy named Milt\n complaining about the hero\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_2,"Even the old man says some stupid things sometimes. \n I don't like his attitude either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_3,"Even though I’m more useless than you, \n why don’t you complain to me?!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_4,"...It was as usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_1,"Enamel-sama's research results were \n an elixir for preserving food."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_2,"Langao Village is very cold, so \n we preserve food by freezing it, but \n it's interesting to see a different preservation method."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_3,"Many parts of our lives are probably supported by \n the power of the sage's research."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_2_1,"This is the cloak that the queen ordered...\n I'm curious to see what the completed cloak will look like.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_2_2,"Let's go talk to the armor shop."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_3_1,"Sir {pc}! The Queen seems to be \n in trouble, so \n let us help her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_5_1,"I would like to respond \n to Princess Julia's feelings for Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_6_1,"I understand that your mother is worried, but \n everyone is with me, so \n I'm not worried about anything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_6_2,"{pc}\n Thank you for your continued support."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_1,"Former Potsukon No. 2 is always asking for favors. \n If you become useless like me, \n no one will ask for favors."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_2,"Ah, Mr. Duston, I think you can be reliable as a traveling companion."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_3,"Hey! Yu Yu Yu The hero princess \n has praised me! What a shame! \n Former Potsukon No. 2! Please taunt me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_4,"Ah... oh, I guess I said something \n wrong...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_1_1,"Queen...\n You seem to be in trouble because you haven't finished your cloak. \n Let us help you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_2_1,"If it's difficult to obtain the materials, \n means you'll be dealing with tough monsters.\n...Heh, it's ringing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_3_1,"Just hearing the name, Moonlight Golden Thread, \n you can tell how beautiful it is. \n I want to see it soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_5_1,"An embroidered cloak made of precious thread...\n I'm sure it's a gift for someone special."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_6_1,"The watchtower is located \n south of the Grand Zedora Kingdom. \n Look for the monster you want near there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_4_1,"Is it a watchtower? \n I don't know what it's guarding, but if you climb to the top \n it looks like it'll be easier to find junk in the distance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_4_2,"Instead of climbing the watchtower, \n we are going to defeat the monsters near it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_1_1,"In order not to keep the queen waiting, \n let's hurry and defeat the monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_2_1,"I've gathered the amount of moonlight gold thread you requested.\n If you have this much, you won't have any trouble making a cloak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_2_2,"Let's go to the armor shop quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_3_1,"Very beautiful thread... \n With this, I think you can make a fine cloak \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_5_1,"I hope the Queen will be happy with the cloak \n made using this beautiful thread."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_6_1,"Now all you have to do is deliver the Moonlight Gold Thread you collected to \n Mr. Renken at the armor shop."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_4_1,"I have no interest in glittering threads, so please deliver them to me quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_1_1,"Moonlight gold thread... It's so beautiful. \n Indeed, \n it might be an appropriate material for the cloak the queen requested."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_1_2,"Let's quickly take it to the armor shop and have them finish the \n cloak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_2_1,"I'm sure the queen will be happy when the cloak is completed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_3_1,"I hope the cloak is completed soon and \n I can see the happy face of the queen \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_5_1,"The only thing left to do is to report to Princess Julia. \n I think Princess Julia's private room was on the third floor of Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_6_1,"Your mother's request has been completed. \n I hope this will put your mother's mind at least a little \n at ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_4_1,"I'd like junk as a thank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_4_2,"Huh?...I wonder if there was any junk in Gran Zedora Castle that \n Mr. Duston would be happy with?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_1_1,"I'm sure the Queen is looking forward to \n the completion of the cloak. Let's go back to the castle and \n tell the Queen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_2_1,"Prince Thoma has been fighting \n desperately for Anlucia for a long time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_2_2,"Yes. That's why I will become a great hero and live up to my brother's name."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_3_1,"Queen...I wonder how you felt when Prince Thomas told you \n that he would be taking Anlucia's place..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_3_2,"Either way, \n our beloved child is in danger... \n That feeling is indescribable to us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_5_1,"The cloak you requested was \n an offering to the deceased Prince Thoma..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_1,"Hey {pc}\n I'll do a favor for you too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_2,"Your mother is going to offer a cloak\n to the royal tombs north of the Rebel Road\n.I want you to go with me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_3,"Toma-niisama said that he was proud of being able to protect me.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_4,"So, for Toma-niisama, \n I will become a splendid hero worthy of the legend. \n I want to report this in front of Toma-niisama's grave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_4_1,"I have no interest in the royal tombs! \n There are only precious things!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_1,"Prince Thoma was a fine man who was determined to protect his sister\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_2,"Inheriting that determination, \n we will continue to protect Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_3,"Thank you, Maille-san.\n I'm counting on you.\n But...please let me protect everyone too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_6_1,"How dare you steal Touma-niisama's body...\n Why would you do such a terrible thing!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_6_2,"I'm fine.\n I'm more worried about your mother's condition."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_5_1,"I've heard that royal tombs are easy targets for tomb robbers \n, but I can't believe they would steal Prince Thoma's body..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_5_2,"This treatment is too much for Princess Julia and \n Princess Anlucia, who are already hurt."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_2_1,"...The queen has also collapsed \n Maybe we should go back to the castle first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_3_1,"I wonder why the prince's body is missing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_3_2,"...No, I don't care about the reason.\n Anyway, we have to find the prince's body!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_4_1,"There are some people who can't do anything about stealing a dead body \n!\n Even I wouldn't do something like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_1_1,"Who stole Prince Thoma's body...! \n Making the Queen and Anlucia sad over and over again...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_2_1,"...I'll keep quiet about what I saw in the royal tombs.\n I'll keep my promise to the queen.\n Find Prince Thoma's body right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_3_1,"I hope the prince's body is found soon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_3_2,"Dear {pc}.\n If there's anything we can do to help, let's do something!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_5_1,"Princess Julia must be suffering \n so as not to make the people around her uneasy\n I see you are enduring it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_6_1,"...As your mother said, \n If you make too much noise, \n you won't be able to find anything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_6_2,"Leave the search for Touma-niisama's body to Captain Nogato.\n We will report to Luchenda-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_4_1,"When a grave is vandalized, it starts to glow \n Isn't this pendulum of fate \n a piece of crap?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_4_2,"It may be that the theft of Prince Thoma's body has a lot to do with \n our fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_1_1,"I hope it doesn't put any more stress on the Queen's body and mind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_1_2,"Mr. {pc}, let us \n do what we have to do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_6_1,"The places where you can find things are \n the Waldo water source in the false world, the Rhône Forest belt \n, and the Defel Wilderness."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_6_2,"It doesn't seem necessary to fight monsters, so let's collect them quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_5_1,"We don't need anything special to investigate, but \n collecting them is something only those of us who have Brave Stones can do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_1,"The sage Sama's errands are water, grass, and stones.\n It's a pain, but I have no choice but to do it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_2,"What is the \n investigation that Lucienda-sama will conduct?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_3,"Come on. Sage Sama has a deep plan that we would never imagine. \n Even if we thought about it, we wouldn't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_3_1,"I wonder what kind of investigation Luchenda-sama will do with water, grass, and stones \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_3_2,"I'm sure this is amazing research that I can't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_4_1,"Water, grass, stones...\n Are you jealous of my collection of junk?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_4_2,"I don't think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_1_1,"In the false world where the pendulum pointed \n Let's go get water, grass, and stones."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_6_1,"Water from the Waldo source of the false world \n Grass from the Rhone forest belt \n And stone from the Defel wilderness..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_6_2,"Now we have \n everything we need for the investigation. \n Let's go back to reporting to Lucienda-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_5_1,"As expected of the Sage of the Crown of Wisdom, you can understand \n what is about to happen in this world with something as trivial as this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_2_1,"...water, stones, and grass.\n...Sage Sama's errands\n were surprisingly easy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_2_2,"Let's go back to Granzedora Castle and give what we gathered to \n Sage Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_3_1,"Water, grass, and stones... you've gathered them all! \n To give them to Lucienda \n Let's go back to Gran Zedora's castle!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_4_1,"I found a lot of things too!\n What do you think about this weird smelling water!\n Dirty colored grass! Stones that are hard to hold!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_4_2,"…What?\n I won’t give it to you if you make that face!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_1_1,"I worked hard to collect them, but...\n What does this have to do with ordinary water, grass, and stones causing something strange?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_1_2,"No matter how you look at it, \n it doesn't seem like anything special..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_6_1,"Let's go \n to the royal treasury in Sea Breeze Cave. I'm worried about the soldiers who went to get medicine and haven't returned \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_6_2,"I hope nothing happens..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_1,"Speaking of Sea Breeze Cave, it has the same name as the place where there was a secret passageway to Gran Zedora Castle in the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_2,"Mr. Crows suddenly appeared at that time, but I wonder where he is and what he's doing these days."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_3,"Come to think of it, I still didn't understand why you helped us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_2_1,"It's probably some medicine kept in the treasure room...\n It must be something valuable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_2_2,"I'm worried about the soldiers, so let's go to the royal treasury."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_3_1,"Without medicine, \n Lucienda-sama can't do her research, and \n I'm also worried about the soldiers who haven't returned."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_4_1,"Is it the royal treasure house...? Even in places like that where it seems like there are only \n valuable things, I'll find \n junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_4_2,"I think Ms. Luchenda has sorted out the treasure room \n and disposed of unnecessary items...\n I think it would be better not to tell Mr. Duston."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_1_1,"I'm worried that the soldier I sent to pick up the medicine hasn't \n returned."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_1_2,"If the soldier seems to be in trouble, \n let's help him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_6_1,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_6_2,"{pc}...\n I just want you to believe in me.\n I will never run away again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_5_1,"The Great Demon King stole the previous hero's ring and \n What kind of plan does he plan to use it for?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_5_2,"As sage Lucienda said, \n I don't think it would be useful even if the demons had it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_2_1,"There's no way Anlucia would abandon {pc} and \n us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_2_2,"What did Milt see in Anlucia...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_3_1,"We will stop the Great Demon King's plan \n absolutely.\n That's right, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_4_1,"Stealing a useless ring\n I have to be careful of demons! \n I will definitely protect my junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_1_1,"...I wonder why Milt-san is so cold towards \n Anlucia-san. \n I don't feel good about him as a friend."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_1,"As expected, the Great Demon King Madesagora was trying to invade our world with his false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_2,"If that happens, \n this world may be remade as the Great Demon King pleases."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_3,"It's not just a problem in this world.\nEven people living in a fake world\n don't know what will happen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_4,"Raska, Mayor Gash...\n I want to protect those people too.\n To do that, I need your help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_5,"Also, I'm curious about the presence of the masked man.\n He must be plotting something with the Hero's Ring.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_5_1,"Painting out the true world with a false world...\n I never thought they would do what they tried to do in the town of Seredo on \n all of the Rendersia continent."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_5_2,"No, on the contrary, it may be a plan to wipe out all of Astortia \n. \n We must stop it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_2_1,"If we don't defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora \n before the world is taken away, those in this world will be exposed to \n danger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_2_2,"...We have to protect this world with our hands."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_3_1,"I don't want this world we live in to be taken away by the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_3_2,"We absolutely must stop the Great Demon King's plan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_4_1,"Is the Great Demon King trying to turn this entire world into \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_4_2,"If something like that were to happen, \n all the junk I've collected would be worth the same as \n anything else!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_1_1,"I can't let the Great Demon King Madesagora go wild like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_1_2,"Mr. {pc}!\n Let's definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_6_1,"{pc}. Thank you for accepting the \n request from Captain Nogato."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_6_2,"Please lend me your power so that Touma-niisama can rest in peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_5_1,"Did the culprit go to Arahagiro Kingdom to sell \n the stolen goods after opening up Prince Thoma's grave?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_5_2,"First of all, I think it would be a good idea to go to Arahagiro Castle and talk to a person named Darash who is in charge of \n crime control."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_2_1,"We can't publicly say \n that the prince's body is missing... \n We should take action."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_3_1,"We have to \n secretly search for the prince's body so as not to worry other countries."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_1,"Stealing valuable things and selling them off are boring people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_2,"Huh... Even old men sometimes say \n trivial things. \n I agree. Stealing is boring, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_3,"Absolutely.\n If you want to steal my precious junk like Chile, I understand!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_4,"...Ah, that's right.\n I guess you're a little off.\n This old man..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_1_1,"If Granzedora's soldiers were to go around \n asking around in the Arahagiro Kingdom, \n it would certainly become a big deal..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_1_2,"Let's cooperate with the investigation in Arahagiro Kingdom so that Prince Thoma's body can be found as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_6_1,"The Desert Earth Dragon...\n That's the group of grave robbers that stole Touma-niisama's body."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_6_2,"I'll definitely catch it...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_5_1,"It's \n troubling that they won't cooperate with us in catching the grave robbers, but \n it might actually be convenient for us to proceed with the investigation in secret."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_2_1,"Desert Earth Dragon... That's a pretty good name.\n He's going out of his way to steal treasure from the royal tombs.\n He must be some bastard."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_1,"They're a group of grave robbers who are quick on the run and are inciting monsters... \n They seem formidable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_2,"But it's for the Queen and \n Anlucia. \n You can't say something weak!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_3,"Thank you, Fuura-san."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_4_1,"Desert Earth Dragon...\n I don't know if it's strong or weak\n It smells like a lump!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_1_1,"Mr. Darash and the others can't catch \n grave robbers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_1_2,"It's like stealing from the royal tombs.\n I'm sure they're all good at it.\n Don't let your guard down..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_6_1,"By the time the Desert Earth Dragon entered the royal tomb, \n Brother Thomas' body had already been stolen by someone...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_6_2,"It looks like \n it will be difficult to obtain any more information here. \n Let's go back to Captain Nogato and report."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_1,"It seems Mr. Darash was worried about us and came to us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_2,"When I spoke to him in the Arahagiro Kingdom, \n To be honest, I got the impression that he was a bit insincere, but... \n Maybe he's a nicer person than I thought."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_3,"After all, \n I am just working as a subordinate of King Moonis. \n I also need to develop a better eye for people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_1,"That guy named Darash \n appeared at a really good time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_2,"We were aiming to capture \n the Desert Earth Dragon guys instead of them...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_3,"What do you think...\n We don't know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_3_1,"It's disgusting to rob a grave \n and steal what's inside the coffin!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_4_1,"They were a group of thieves after all. \n I kind of like them!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_1,"If you believe what the thieves said earlier, \n Prince Thoma's body must have been stolen by someone else."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_2,"But no one other than members of the royal family \n should be allowed in the royal tombs..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_3,"Hmm...\n In any case, I think it would be best to report \n to Captain Nogato."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_1_1,"I hope this investigation will make some progress..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_1_2,"If we don't find Prince Thoma's body soon, \n Princess Anlucia and the Queen will continue to suffer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_3_1,"I'm glad that the culprit who stole the prince's burial goods was found, but...\nThe body was never found..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_1,"If you leave the matter about the grave robbers to Captain Nogato, you'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_2,"It's me.\n That person once helped me when I went to subjugate a monster. \n That time, I seriously injured him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_3,"But he laughed it off and comforted me, saying \n My medal has increased by one more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_4,"I may look like a scary person, but \n I'm actually a very kind person. \n I think that's why I was chosen to be a soldier commander."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_5_1,"Aside from the ornaments, why did the real culprit steal \n Prince Thoma's body \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_2_1,"Did the grave robbers tell the truth?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_2_2,"What is the culprit going to do after stealing the prince's body\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_4_1,"Even I have no idea what \n the guy who steals a dead body feels."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_2_1,"Yakupu, the old man \n must have really liked hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_2_2,"It's \n hard not being able to freely go anywhere you like... Let's quickly pick up some branches and shells and \n bring Yunohana from the hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_3_1,"When I heard Mr. Yakup's story \n... it seems like it was a pretty open hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_6_1,"It seems that the hot springs are good for healing injuries, but \n I don't think I can go because my back hurts.\n I feel bad for Yakup-san as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_1_1,"If you have a bad back, it can't be helped that you can't go to a hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_1_2,"Let's take \n Yunohana to the old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_5_1,"I don't think there was a place called Montserro Hot Springs Gorge in the fake world, but... \n Is there a reason?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_5_2,"Come on. \n I guess the Great Demon King hates Flo?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_4_1,"I'll leave it to you \n to look for treasure shells and other beautiful things, and I'll \n look for junk like usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_2_1,"I got the branches and shells. \n Let’s go to the hot spring manager!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_3_1,"It's a pity that Mr. Yakupu himself couldn't bring the white plum branch and \n pale red treasure shell to exchange \n with Yunohana..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_6_1,"It's kind of wonderful to bring \n beautiful shells and scented branches from the seaside as souvenirs to the hot spring gorge in the mountains."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_1_1,"I'd like to exchange white plum branches and pale pink treasure shells for yunohana...\n Maybe it's a bit romantic."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_5_1,"In exchange for Yunohana, you received a branch of white plum blossoms and a pale red jewel shell \n.I guess the hot spring manager likes beautiful things..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_4_1,"...It's a hot spring. \n Even if it's not as strong as the ocean, it's unsettling to be surrounded by a large amount of \n water."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_2_1,"A hot spring, huh?\n You should go to the hot springs to relieve the fatigue of your journey.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_2_2,"It looks really comfortable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_3_1,"It's nice...hot springs.\n I want to soak in it, even if it's just for my feet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_6_1,"Once you've finished everything you need to do, \n it would be nice to relax in a hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_6_2,"When I go to the hot springs, I want to invite my father and \n mother as well. \n Of course, {pc} too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_1_1,"I want to go to the hot springs, but \n Mr. Yakupu is waiting for me. \n Let's deliver Yunohana right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_5_1,"I'm glad that there doesn't seem to be any \n abnormality happening at Montserro Hot Springs Gorge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_4_1,"It's called Yunohana, so \n I was wondering what kind of flower it was, but \n Isn't it a powder with a strange smell?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_4_2,"I kinda liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_2_1,"Yakub's old man, I hope you can heal your back quickly and meet \n Luzina's grandmother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_3_1,"If you like Luzina, wouldn't it be better to talk about sexy gals in moderation?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_6_1,"I'm glad Yakup-san is doing well.\n No matter how old you are, your feelings for others are important.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_1,"Hehe. After all, the two of you \n have been thinking about each other for a long time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_2,"Don't talk about gals \n Wouldn't it be better to stab the old man with a nail?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_3,"If I was thinking about Luzina that much, \n I don't think I would talk about other girls..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_5_1,"Yakub-san will also be able to \n reunite with Luzina-san someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_5_2,"I hope you two stay healthy for longer than the time we spent thinking about each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_4_1,"It's scary how Yunohana can make a weak old person healthy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_4_2,"I don’t think so…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_1,"That woman named Sinon and Ryu-chan are quite into \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_2,"I don't care what you like, but \n trying to make him sing using something as outrageous as a jig file is... that's not funny."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_3,"I can \n tell you that I like Ryu-chan, but... \n It's not good to be too harsh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_3_1,"I'm scared that you're going to force me to sing \n with a file in my neck \n Mr. Sinon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_6_1,"Looks like you can get the Jigoku file \n on Coniware Plains."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_6_2,"...But how do you make someone sing with a file?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_1_1,"Aroldo-chan...Aro-chan...\n Hehe. It doesn't really suit you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_5_1,"I'm asking you to obtain a Jigoku file.\n Is it really a good idea to accept\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_5_2,"No... No, \n {pc} made the decision. \n I'm sure it'll be fine, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_4_1,"That client, Sinon, is like me and can't do anything other than what she likes.\n She smells like a piece of shit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_4_2,"I'm looking forward to seeing how you use the jigoku file when you get it \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_2_1,"I got a file for Jigoku, but...\n Is Ryu-chan okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_3_1,"I got the Jigoku file, but I wonder if \n I really can give it to Mr. Sinon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_3_2,"Since you asked for it, \n I have no choice but to give it to you... \n I'm a little worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_6_1,"I don't know much about it, but \n I wonder if there's a song about using a file?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_1_1,"A jigoku file... \n Neither the name nor the appearance \n looks like a tool that can make humans sing, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_1_2,"Anyway, let's give it to Sinon-san.\n And if anything happens, we can help Ryu-chan\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_5_1,"Ugh...I wonder how you can make people sing with such a jagged file."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_4_1,"I'm looking forward to seeing what that client will do with the \n file!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_2_1,"Driftwood Ryu-chan...\n Do you understand that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_2_2,"Anyway, I was relieved that it wasn't a person \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_3_1,"I'm glad Ryu-chan was made of driftwood..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_1,"I'm an instrument craftsman who loves musical instruments...\n I don't think I'll be able to imitate him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_2,"I learned to play musical instruments when I was little.\n My mother told me that this was also the behavior of a princess of the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_3,"But it seems like I don't have the talent.\n No matter how much I practice, I just can't play well.\n It seems like I've gotten complaints from somewhere..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_4,"Ever since then, I don't like playing instruments.\n I love listening to them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_5,"Ah. Sorry. \n I keep talking about myself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_1_1,"Driftwood Ryu-chan...\n Indeed, as a name, \n doesn't seem out of place."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_1_2,"But it also sounds like someone's name, so \n I get it wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_5_1,"It's important to convey correct information...\n I also have to be careful not to be misunderstood by people..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_4_1,"Guppupu!\n The client was quite the weirdo!\n I can't lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_4_2,"I don't think I've lost enough even as it is now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_2_1,"Is it Kuro-sama this time... \n Isn't it Kuro-sama from Clover?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_2_2,"I can't help but doubt it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_3_1,"I want to support Sinon-san's love. \n Let's do everything we can! \n Dear {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_6_1,"I'm a little jealous. \n I wonder what it feels like to make an effort for the person you love."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_1,"When you admire someone you like, it feels like \n I don't really understand, but \n I admire you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_2,"Lord Arold…………\n Lord Arro…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_3,"No, I'm a little embarrassed! \n Now, let's quickly collect the toad oil and \n bones of the ancient dragon to make the flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_5_1,"Kuro-sama...?\n I'm a little concerned, but \n Let's prioritize gathering materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_4_1,"I'm not interested in things like love, but \n You're a lot more polished than last time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_2_1,"I'll take the toad oil and the bones of the ancient dragon and return to \n Sinon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_2_2,"What kind of guy is \n asking me to make a flute out of something like this...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_3_1,"I wonder what kind of flute Mr. Sinon is planning to make with the oil of the cattail and the bones of the ancient dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_3_2,"It's hard to imagine just looking at the materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_6_1,"The only thing left to do is deliver \n the materials for the flute to Sinon, the maiden in love. \n Gama's oil... Did you have it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_1_1,"Now, Sinon-san will be able to make \n a flute for Kuro-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_1_2,"I don't know what kind of flute it will be made from the oil of the cattail and the bones of the ancient dragon \n, but... \n I'm sure Kuro-sama will like it too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_5_1,"If you make a flute with these bones, \n what kind of sound will it make? \n I'm a little curious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_4_1,"I'd rather have the fish bones \n after they've eaten than the precious bones of ancient dragons!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_2_1,"...Sinon can only see Kuro-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_3_1,"Sinon-san, you really love Kuro-sama.I hope Kuro-sama will like the flute that Sinon-san made."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_6_1,"I hope Kuro-sama will be happy with the flute that Sinon-san makes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_6_2,"Anyway, Kuro-sama is a name I heard somewhere \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_1_1,"I'm sure Sinon-san can make \n a wonderful flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_1_2,"I hope you can convey your feelings to Kuro-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_5_1,"The pendulum of fate has \n power again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_5_2,"Is there any connection between Sinon-san’s love and our fate?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_4_1,"Even if I make it according to the instructions, the whistle doesn't make a proper sound! \n That guy named Kuro-sama \n does a pretty good job."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_1,"I can't imagine that a monster would want a stone tablet...\n Even if the characters are difficult for humans to decipher, \n Can a monster read it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_2,"I can't deny that possibility. \n There are probably monsters in this world who are more intelligent than us and have deeper knowledge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_3,"Intelligence and knowledge….\n For some reason, it reminded me of the Garden of Learning."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_3_1,"The mystery of the lithograph...I'm really interested in it too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_3_2,"Dear {pc}, let's defeat Stoneman and return the \n Slate to the Doctor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_6_1,"I wonder what Stoneman is going to do with \n taking the tablets? \n I hope he doesn't eat them..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_1_1,"Dr. Rossum's research will not progress if the tablet remains stolen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_1_2,"Defeat Stoneman in Solaria Canyon and retrieve the \n Slate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_5_1,"Ancient history and culture are also precious treasures.\n Let's recover the stolen tablets."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_4_1,"You're a monster with no sense \n for stealing a stone tablet that is useful for research!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_4_2,"Is it a matter of taste...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_2_1,"It's a really old stone tablet.\n I have no idea what it says on it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_2_2,"I have no idea what it's worth, but...\n Well, it's important to that doctor. \n Let's deliver it to him quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_3_1,"Let's give the tablet back to the doctor.\n What is written on this tablet?\n I want Dr. Rossum to tell me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_6_1,"I'm glad you got the stone tablet back safely.\n...It hasn't been chewed on, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_1_1,"We successfully retrieved the tablet.\nNow, let's go deliver it to Dr. Rossum."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_5_1,"This stone tablet is filled with \n past history and culture. \n We have to cherish it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_4_1,"I'm not interested in precious stone tablets! \n I'll collect \n the stones around there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_4_2,"Yes, yes, Mr. Duston. \n I'll collect the stones later, \n and I'll go give the tablet to Dr. Rossum."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_2_1,"All of Astortia is shaking\n God's mystery..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_2_2,"It's so grand that I can't get enough of it. \n My goal is to defeat the enemy in front of me, \n and protect the person I want to protect. I hope I can do that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_3_1,"I can't believe that the human god's \n great secret was written on that stone tablet...! \n I'm glad we were able to get it back from the monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_3_2,"You said that you would \n tell me a new story once the deciphering progresses. \n I'm looking forward to it, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_1,"...I see.The object of worship that was found in the ruins of \n Old God in Solaria Canyon was \n Gran Zenis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_2,"By the way, there is also a book written about the god Gran Zenis in the library of Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_3,"According to that, the god Gran Zenis bestowed \n the power of destroying demons and saving the world \n on selected humans."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_4,"That's right... That's the beginning of being a hero.\n I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the god Gran Zenis is the \n origin of the Kingdom of Gran Zedora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_5,"Yeah. It was a good opportunity for me to once again remember my mission as a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_1,"What if… if our travels were written on stone tablets and remained until the distant future, I wonder if someone would read them and study them…"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_2,"It's a very romantic story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_3,"When I think about that, I get kind of nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_5_1,"Because of scholars like Dr. Rossum, \n we can carve a new future \n based on history."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_4_1,"Aww!! \n I'm so chilled that I helped you make such a valuable discovery!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_2_1,"I'll pick up the \n tool bag at the ship management station south of Rendoa, then deliver it to the engineer at \n Lagi Snowfield... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_2_2,"...It's a pain, but \n That engineer must be in trouble too. \n Let's go to the ship management office first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_3_1,"I guess you can \n deliver the tool bag that the engineer forgot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_6_1,"Captain Abram seemed to be quite concerned about \n considering it was just something he forgot... \n Did something happen?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_1_1,"It's my work tool, so \n I would probably notice \n that I forgot my bag, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_5_1,"The Grand Titus \n to the Kingdom of Gran Zedora \n seems to be going smoothly, which is great."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_5_2,"If Captain Abram is interested in this request, \n I would also like to cooperate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_4_1,"If you're an engineer, you probably have one or two pieces of junk \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_2_1,"You won't be able to do your job with a broken spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_2_2,"'Let's go get some high-tech spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_3_1,"Dear {pc}! \n Let's go get you \n a high-tech spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_6_1,"It's a problem for the station staff as well.\n We thought it was a boarding ship.\n Let's get the high-tech wrench too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_6_2,"I believe \n ghouls sometimes drop high-tech spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_1,"In order to receive the tool bag, \n I need to find a high-tech spanner. \n A ghoul in the west of Guren territory... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_2,"I have visited the western part of Guren territory several times \n with Arold. I think there were many strong monsters in the area where there were ghouls."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_3,"However, this was before we traveled together with {pc} and the others...\n It shouldn't be too difficult for us now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_1,"Why does a ghoul have a high-tech spanner \n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_2,"Come on. You'll pick up anything that falls, like Duston's old man \n, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_3,"I don't pick up anything!\n Just useless junk!\n Don't underestimate me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_4,"It seems like…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_4_1,"You didn't do the work I was asked to do and forced you to \n on me...\n That's a lot of crap!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_2_1,"With this high-tech wrench, \n technicians will have no trouble doing maintenance work."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_3_1,"It seems like a high-tech spanner will \n work faster than a regular spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_6_1,"Now all you have to do is pick up your tool bag at the ship control station and deliver it to the \n engineer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_1_1,"Let's take the high-tech spanner to \n Mr. Yakkoi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_5_1,"I see...\n There are many different types of spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_4_1,"A useful spanner for free\n is high-tech and shiny...\n It's the worst!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_2_1,"For what reason did the captain and the engineer, who were polite adults, fight \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_2_2,"I heard that Engineer Pageo and Captain Abram have been friends for decades. \n I hope their relationship doesn't deteriorate like this..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_3_1,"I'm trying to have the tool bag delivered to Mr. Vallejo \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_3_2,"The captain is also aware that things can't go on like this \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_6_1,"I thought Captain Abram was \n a calm person, but \n he gets into big fights..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_1_1,"Regardless of the reason, we're still friends\n so it's better to make up before we get stuck.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_1_2,"...before the relationship gets strained and we end up hurting each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_5_1,"It's a nice gesture to \n replace a broken wrench when delivering something you forgot to someone you had a fight with."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_4_1,"If you were to replace it with a high-tech spanner, \n you wouldn't hand over your broken spanner to me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_2_1,"Kindness is something you do \n without even realizing it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_2_2,"I think it would have been good if \n the old man from Pageo realized that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_3_1,"I guess Mr. Vallejo and the captain had different feelings and got into a fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_3_2,"It's hard to be friends when trying to please someone \n ends up in a fight... \n It's hard to be friends."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_6_1,"I'm really glad that we were able to reconcile the two of you with our help.\n All that's left now is to report to Captain Abram."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_1_1,"Both the captain and Mr. Pageo \n are clumsy people who can't express their feelings in words."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_1_2,"...Hehe, I remembered \n Arold and Giganf."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_5_1,"I thought the exchange of spanners was a courtesy, but \n it turned out to be a message from the captain. \n Friendship is difficult..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_4_1,"The best thing about tools is that they are bare!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_2_1,"It's so troublesome, the old men's fight has finally settled down."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_2_2,"Friendships that have been nurtured over a long period of time are not easily broken."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_3_1,"I'm glad that the captain and Vallejo were able to make up \n Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_1,"I'm glad I was able to help Captain Abram.\n I used to be indebted to the captain."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_2,"When I was little, I didn't like ships...\n I didn't even want to go on the Grand Titus.\n I complained a lot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_3,"But when the captain heard \n he stayed by my side the whole time... \n He told me fun stories about the sea until we arrived at the port."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_4,"Since then, I feel comfortable going on the ship.\n I am still very grateful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_5,"Someday, if I have a chance, I will tell you the sea story that the captain told me. \n It was a really fun story!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_1_1,"I'm relieved that the captain and Mr. Pageo were able to make up \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_1_2,"It's definitely not good for things to go on like that... relations are strained \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_5_1,"Thinking about things from a broader perspective...\n Even if you think you understand it, it's difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_1,"It's your fault that the new device is better\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_2,"But thanks to that, we were able to go to \n Rendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_3,"Pugy!\n I'll put up with it for Rendersia's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_1,"I'm sure there are \n things in the past that you don't want anyone to know about..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_2,"Hey {pc}!\n I have a request to investigate a guy named Zodera...\n If you accept it, I'll help you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_3,"I don't really care about it.\n...and that priest named Juaro\n doesn't really bother me either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_3_1,"I understand Juaro-san's point, but \n I think it's not a good idea to secretly investigate the other party."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_3_2,"I feel confused somehow..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_6_1,"Mr. Juaro spoke in a bit of a prickly way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_6_2,"If there are no problems after questioning, \n I'm sure you'll agree."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_1_1,"I feel a little uncomfortable \n investigating other people's backgrounds..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_1_2,"{pc}-san, let's listen to the story quickly and \n without attracting too much attention."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_1,"I understand why the person who becomes the high priest of the Dharma Temple should be \n clean and innocent, but \n I don't feel very good about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_2,"But what kind of person is Mr. Zodera?\n I don't think listening to the stories of everyone at the Dharma Temple is a bad thing in itself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_3,"Even if a bad rumor comes out...\nIt is an important responsibility of those in higher positions\n to know about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_1,"That priest named Juaro \n Looks like a fool and I hate him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_2,"This time, I agree with the old man.\n I don't want a guy who looks like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_3,"Hmm? Huza... It seems that you have finally awakened to \n your path as my comrade! You are most welcome!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_4,"No, I don't know about the Ponkotsu road!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_2_1,"Did you get to hear the story?\n...Priests called Zodera don't seem to want to get involved with other people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_3_1,"I heard a lot of stories from everyone at the temple.\n...Mr. Zodera is very strict.\n It feels a little scary."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_6_1,"The results of the investigation are not clear. \n In any case, let's tell Mr. Juaro \n what we heard."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_1_1,"It's a bit unnatural for a priest who is passionate about his training to go to a bar...\n It might just be a chance to take a breather, but\n It's a bit unnatural to be with someone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_5_1,"Based on what I heard \n, I can't say anything yet..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_4_1,"Is that priest named Zodera a drinker with whom you have a bad relationship?\n I think it's good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_2_1,"...I don't really feel like it, but \n I've already accepted all the requests. \n Since I've been asked to do it, I have no choice but to do it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_3_1,"Now I have to \n follow Mr. Zodera..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_3_2,"Background checks can be daunting."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_6_1,"...I guess that's what's going to happen.\n I'm also concerned that things remain unclear.\n If this happens, let's keep in touch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_1_1,"...It's not good for you to secretly investigate people behind their backs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_1_2,"But \n it's not good for you to throw away something you've already accepted. \n Let's go to the bar in Ceredo!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_5_1,"Ugh. You're the kind of person who searches for people like this... \n But when you turn down a request once you've accepted it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_4_1,"Sounds interesting! \n Let's go to the bar in Ceredo and find out if a priest called Zodera is a weirdo or not!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_1,"...Didn't that guy Zodera say something pretty \n weird?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_2,"I couldn't hear who he was talking about, but \n he said, I was the one who killed him''..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_3,"I don't want to believe it, but \n I think it might happen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_3_1,"What Zodera-san was saying \n I couldn't hear it very well, but \n you were talking dangerously..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_6_1,"That person named Zodera \n I feel like I've seen her somewhere...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_1_1,"Mr. Zodera...\n said something quite disturbing at the bar, but\n I couldn't catch the important part."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_1_2,"Let's go report to Mr. Juaro what we heard earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_5_1,"It wasn't like he was joking, and \n I don't think it's very easy to kill him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_4_1,"I like weirdos, but \n I'm not interested in murdering people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_2_1,"A witness...\n I wonder if the High Priest Sama will believe what we saw?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_3_1,"Zodera-san...\n I wonder if you really gave up on people in the past..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_6_1,"…………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_6_2,"Ah. Sorry {pc}. \n I was just thinking. \n Shall we go to the High Priest?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_1_1,"If you have a history of giving up on \n people who might become the next high priest, \n that's a big problem..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_1_2,"I think I understand \n Mr. Juaro's feelings of hurry."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_5_1,"The story has turned into a big deal.\n But if it's true that you abandoned someone, \n we can't just ignore it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_4_1,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\n I have no interest in killing people, so please finish this request quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_2_1,"I understand Juaro's point, but \n Grand Priest Sama is too supportive of Zodera.\n...Is it just my imagination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_3_1,"Isn't it better to believe in the words of the High Priest and not pursue Mr. Zodera too deeply?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_6_1,"That's what the high priest said\n I'm sure it'll be fine.\n I also feel like I can trust Zodera-san."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_1_1,"In the first place, our story alone is not enough to convince the \n High Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_1_2,"I just overheard \n Zodera talking about something disturbing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_5_1,"The high priest probably has something in mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_4_1,"Come on! Let’s accept \n thanks from a priest named Juaro and move on!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_4_2,"I'd be happy if I could get some junk, but \n I can't expect much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_2_1,"If Zodera was a bad person, \n Grand Priest Sama wouldn't be on our side..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_2_2,"Mr. Zodera is a scary person, but \n he's probably not a bad person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_3_1,"The High Priest may know Mr. Juaro and \n Mr. Zodera that we don't know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_3_2,"I guess that's why I trust Zodera-san."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_6_1,"Hey {pc}. Would you like to talk to \n the dancer of the traveling entertainer troupe in the temple courtyard?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_6_2,"My friend Janna was also \n a dancer in a traveling entertainer troupe, so I was interested in her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_1_1,"Juaro-san doesn't seem to agree, but \n I think it's better to leave it to the High Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_5_1,"Juaro-san seems to be remorseful as well, so \n I guess he was really worried about the future of the Dharma Temple and asked us \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_4_1,"By the way, there was a traveling entertainer troupe in the courtyard. \n They might have some nice junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_2_1,"In order for Reedy's wish to come true, \n let's take her to the Hill of Hope in the Rhône Forest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_3_1,"Make a wish on the bud of the flower of hope….\n Can I try it too, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_6_1,"...{pc}. \n Let's go to \n the hill where the flower of hope blooms in the Rhone forest belt."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_6_2,"So that Mr. Lidi can make a wish to \n the Flower of Hope..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_1_1,"If you make a wish on a bud and when the flower blooms, \n your dream will come true. How romantic!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_5_1,"A flower that makes dreams come true...\n What a wonderful story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_4_1,"You can get all the junk in the world just by making a wish on a flower!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_4_2,"If it's all a lie that dreams come true\n Well then, that's a lot of crap!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_2_1,"Reedy guy...\n Even if Zodera says something unpleasant\n I hope you don't get discouraged and do your best."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_3_1,"I can't forgive you for saying something negative to Mr. Lidi who is trying his best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_1,"Lidi admired Janna and became \n a dancer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_2,"Janna was a dancer who was so thrilling to watch \n and did such wonderful dances, but \n she's already passed away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_3,"But I also didn't know that the Shitar troupe that Janna was in became \n the Gizanto troupe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_1_1,"Even though Mr. Reedy is motivated, \n I don't have to say anything to push him away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_1_2,"I guess Mr. Zodera doesn't want to interact with anyone \n after all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_5_1,"Is it because Mr. Zodera was cold towards Mr. Lidi because he thought you were immature?\n I don't think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_4_1,"That dancer named Lidi\n is incredibly positive, isn't she?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_4_2,"Even if you're not good at it at first, \n you'll work hard and get better at it, so \n just look at it, it's not my thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_2_1,"That stubby-looking man \n was originally the chairman of a traveling entertainer troupe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_2_2,"The fact that you didn't respond to \n the old man from Gizant's persuasion means that Janna feels responsible for \n the dancer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_3_1,"I wonder if Zodera-san is devoting herself to her training because she feels guilty for \n losing Janna-san..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_3_2,"If that's the case, perhaps Zodera-san has too much sense of responsibility..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_6_1,"Mr. Zodera is the chairman of the Shital troupe...\n I felt like I had seen him somewhere before, but I guess that's what happened after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_6_2,"...I can't believe he felt so responsible for Janna's death that he quit the \n troupe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_1_1,"After losing Janna-san, I wonder if \n I have lost sight of the meaning of my job as chairperson."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_5_1,"The reason I heard you say killed'' at the bar before was because \n Mr. Zodera felt that much responsible for \n Mr. Janna's death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_5_2,"Is this what the High Priest said there was nothing to worry about?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_4_1,"Not only do you want to drink it, but you're a serious priest!\n I'm totally disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_4_2,"I want you to emulate my potsucon a little!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_2_1,"Hey, hey...\n Are you in trouble before the appointment ceremony...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_3_1,"What is the troupe's problem...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_3_2,"{pc}, if we can do anything \n, let's help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_6_1,"{pc}.\n I will also ask you to do so.\n Let's solve the problem of the Gizanto troupe together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_1_1,"The fact that the High Priest is asking us for \n cooperation may be \n a big problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_1_2,"Let's hear from Mr. Gizanto."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_5_1,"In the basement of the Dharma Temple, \n offer prayers for peace in this world... \n The high priest had such a role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_5_2,"Is it like Azran's wind ceremony?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_4_1,"So, you just agreed to help someone?\n As a thank you, this time I’ll get \n some junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_2_1,"Wow, it's such a fuss that the costumes haven't arrived yet.\n Well, let's go find them quickly.\n It's a village between Ceredo and Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_1,"I totally understand why Reedi-san is so particular about costumes.Because with costumes, you can bear everyone's expectations and feelings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_2,"When I wore the Kaze no Koromo at the Kazeokuri no Ceremony, \n I felt that everyone \n gave me power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_3,"Dear {pc}. Let's go find \n an outfit for Reedy so she can \n dance for everyone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_6_1,"Dancers' costumes are like weapons for us, so it can't be helped that Mr. Reedi is concerned about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_6_2,"Speaking of a village between Arahagiro and \n Dharma Temple... \n Is it near the waterfall in the Llana Desolation Area?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_1_1,"If the costumes don't arrive, \n Reedy won't be able to dance! \n Let's hurry to the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_5_1,"Mr. Reedy was \n enthusiastic about making Mr. Zodera have fun...\n I want to make sure he is fully prepared so that he can dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_4_1,"There's no junk in Dharma Temple, so \n I'd be happy to accompany you \n on your way to Arahagiro, looking for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_2_1,"I didn't know that the delivery man was attacked by monsters.\n If that's the case, then we should have come.\n It was the right thing to do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_2_2,"{pc}!\n Hurry up and get \n Reedy's outfit back from Star Lemming!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_3_1,"We will absolutely get back \n Reedy-san's precious costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_6_1,"The one who stole the costume was Star Lemming!\n If you hurry, he should still have it with him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_1_1,"I can't believe you stole my precious costume! \n Let's quickly get it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_5_1,"If we hadn't come, \n we almost wouldn't have received the costume. \n Now, let's find the monster that stole the costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_4_1,"Stealing a dancer's costume \n You're a monster that stinks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_2_1,"You managed to get the dancer's costume back.\n Okay, let's get the costume quickly.\n Reedy and the others are waiting!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_3_1,"If we don't quickly deliver the costume to Mr. Reedy, \n Mr. Reedy's turn will begin!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_6_1,"I'm glad you got your costume back!\n Now all you have to do is deliver it to Mr. Lidi.\n Let's hurry back to the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_1_1,"I have to hurry and deliver the precious costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_5_1,"I'm glad your costume hasn't been bitten.\n Let's go back to the Dharma Temple before Mr. Lidi's turn comes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_4_1,"It's not that easy to find nice junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_4_2,"Hmm? Did you find what you were looking for \n? \n If you want to deliver it, I'll go right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_2_1,"I managed to deliver the costume in time.I'm relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_2_2,"Then let's enjoy Lidi's dance \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_3_1,"That's Lidi-san's dance...\n I'm sure it's really beautiful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_6_1,"I see...that costume belongs to Janna...\n Mr. Lidi respects Janna so much..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_6_2,"If Janna was alive \n I'm sure she would be happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_1_1,"Standing on stage \n dancing in the same costume as the person you admire...isn't it wonderful?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_5_1,"I completely understand how you want to get closer to the person you admire \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_5_2,"When I become king someday, I will be like your father."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_4_1,"I'm going to the temple courtyard!\n Since you asked me to come watch the dance, \n I can't even look for junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_2_1,"I can't believe that Zodera old man \n is encouraging Lidi over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_2_2,"...Heh, there are some good things about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_3_1,"Reedi-san's dance...\n I was really nervous when I fell down, but \n I'm glad I was able to dance till the end!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_3_2,"Thanks to the old man from Zodera."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_1,"Those words from Mr. Zodera...\n The performance ends when the audience applauds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_2,"...My journey as a hero will end when \n I defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora \n and the people can live in peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_3,"I can't afford to lose to Lidi-san!\n So {pc}\n I look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_1_1,"Reedi-san’s dance \n was so amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_1_2,"I want to see you again somewhere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_1,"Mr. {pc}....\n I'm really impressed right now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_2,"As the high priest said, \n I felt as if my soul had been shaken by Reedy's dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_3,"Yes. \n Janna's dancing was also very nice, but \n it was just as good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_4_1,"That dancer named Lidi is well-suited to becoming popular.\n I don't think she has any connection with me, who likes to play."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_2_1,"The old man from Zodera... no, Chairman Shital. \n The way he encouraged Reedy during the entertainment \n He certainly looked like the chairman of a troupe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_2_2,"I ended up going back to the troupe instead of the High Priest Sama, but...I think it was a good thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_3_1,"If Mr. Shital returns to the chair, \n Mr. Lidi will become a great dancer\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_3_2,"Ah, that's right. \n I'm sure you'll build a good teacher-pupil relationship."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_1,"Janna's death was not \n Shital's fault. \n I'm glad you returned to the chair."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_2,"I'm sure Lidi-san will bring smiles to the faces of \n as many people as Janna."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_3,"When we defeat the Great Demon King and peace is achieved, \n I would like to ask him to perform at Gran Zedora Castle again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_1,"Reedy-san's dance \n moved the hearts of others \n It was amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_2,"Yes, I think dancers and traveling entertainers are \n amazing. Their performances can brighten people's hearts \n and energize them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_3,"I also respect people like them who use their honed skills to cheer up your soul. \n ...Uncle Nablett, I hope you're doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_1,"It was all prepared by the high priest...\n As expected of someone who protects the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_2,"Laguas-kun will become a worthy \n king, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_3,"Of course. \n To that end, I have to learn more \n on this journey!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_1,"The Dharma Temple is not my cup of tea after all, with no junk or junk.\n Please call me when it becomes a ruin."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_2,"I wonder if Mr. Duston\n will be alive by then...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_3,"Well, even Mr. Duston \n wouldn't it be difficult...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_4,"No... I'm talking about an old man, so \n I don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_5,"Uh, {pc}...\n Mr. Duston, isn't everyone treating you strangely...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_2_1,"Delivering a hot spring souvenir to an old man\n Cleaning up after a fight between older adults...\n Will something like this change fate?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_2_2,"If it helped someone \n that's fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_3_1,"...Reedy-san's dance was beautiful. \n I want to see it again. Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_3_2,"For that reason, we must use the power of the pendulum of fate to stop the Great Demon King's plan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_1_1,"By helping those in need, \n I was able to gather the power of destiny, so \n I was able to kill two birds with one stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_1_2,"Killing three birds with one stone by exterminating monsters and strengthening your body?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_5_1,"Compared to the time I visited the true world's Melsandi Cered\n Arahagiro, \n there were no major incidents."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_5_2,"Even if each event is small, \n the accumulation of them may change \n a huge flow that can be called destiny."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_1,"Even though I was just helping them make strange musical instruments, \n the power of destiny came together..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_2,"As expected, the former Potsucon 2 is destined to summon the ponkotsu! \n There was no madness in my eyes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_3,"...Since the old man is following me, \n I can't say it was a mistake."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_6_1,"Looks like the pendulum of fate is full of power again.\n Let's go back to report to Lady Lucienda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_2_1,"Anlucia guy, don't think about the future \n Don't jump out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_2_2,"Quickly, let's chase down \n Anlucia to Solaria Canyon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_3_1,"We have to stop Anlucia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_3_2,"Let’s go to Solaria Canyon! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_1_1,"Hurry up and chase Anlucia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_1_2,"Mr. Anlucia's face looks demonic....\n It's dangerous to let her go like that...\n Let's hurry to Solaria Canyon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_5_1,"Astortia's hope is to be a hero...\n No, even if she is not a hero\n Princess Anlucia is our friend!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_5_2,"We can't afford to lose you, \n {pc}! Hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_4_1,"I can't believe you left without thinking\n There's more to see than I expected! \n I'm going too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_2_1,"That Milt guy...\n He seemed to hate Anlucia, but\n He protected her from monster attacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_2_2,"What's wrong with my friend...\n What happened?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_3_1,"I think Lady Anlucia is preoccupied with \n the prince's Kataki... \n That's why we have to support her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_1_1,"I hope you go back to your usual Anlucia-san."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_1_2,"It's dangerous to leave you alone. \n Let's follow!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_1,"What exactly is that technique that {pc} used to protect \n Princess Anlucia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_2,"...I see. \n {pc} doesn't really understand either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_3,"It seems that Lucienda-sama has noticed what that is \n, but... \n Right now, we should go after Princess Anlucia first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_4_1,"Not once, but twice!\n Well, I can't lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_2_1,"The masked man's true identity is \n Anlucia's big brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_2_2,"Even though I know we are the enemy, \n I feel heavy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_3_1,"The reunion between Princess Anlucia and Prince Thomas will be \n painful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_3_2,"My breasts are hurting too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_1_1,"Mr. Anlucia...\n When you found out that your brother was the masked man, \n you must have been very shocked..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_5_1,"To resurrect Prince Thoma and use him to manipulate \n and invade the world..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_5_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle to think of countermeasures\n and meet up with Princess Anlucia and the others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_4_1,"I can't forgive you for trying to use a dead person as a tool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_2_1,"{pc} is an ally of the hero... \n You have taken on a very important role \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_3_1,"The hero's ally, \n {pc}, was \n an amazing person after all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_1,"…………{pc}.\n I'll only confide in you, but it's me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_2,"When I found out that the masked man was Thomas-niisama, I was really happy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_3,"That's not Toma-niisama anymore. \n I understand. But..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_4,"...I'm sorry. I found out that the Great Demon King's target was \n God's Scarlet Stone. \n I have to be strong..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_5,"'Thank you {pc}. \n I'm glad I talked to you. \n I'm fine now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_1_1,"If {pc} is an ally of the hero, \n I would like you to train me, even though I am still lacking in ability."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_1,"{pc} is an ally of the hero...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_2,"Not only the technique that protected Princess Anlucia\n, but also the encounter with us, the battle with Hades Nergel\n, and the fact that he has helped many people..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_3,"All of them are the guides of fate to fight against the Great Demon King Madesagora as allies of the hero\n...If you think about it that way, it makes sense."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_1,"I can't believe that you, the former Potsucon 2, were anything but an ally of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_2,"Even though you look so absent-minded, \n I missed you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_3,"However, if I stay with you, \n I'm sure I'll meet some crap and crap, so \n I have no choice but to follow you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_2_1,"...The secret technique of destroying evil.\n The test from the sage Sama means\n It must be an amazing technique."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_3_1,"From my point of view, Ms. Anlucia \n is still strong enough, but by learning the secret technique of destroying evil, \n she must become even stronger..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_3_2,"Dear {pc}, I will also \n do my best to become stronger!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_6_1,"Learn the secret technique of destroying evil... To do that, \n First, we need to repair the device in the secret conference room. \n Let's talk to Mr. Milt."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_1_1,"There is a \n secret meeting room in the basement of Gran Zedora Castle... If you look for this castle \n, it seems like there are many secrets."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_5_1,"I can't believe there's even a \n secret conference room for convening wise men.\n As expected from the Kingdom of Granzedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_4_1,"Are you going to the trouble of \n fixing the broken device?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_4_2,"Why don't I take the broken one and make a new one?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_2_1,"...That troublesome old man. \n I agree that he's a proud engineer. \n But... I have no choice but to go."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_3_1,"Mr. Vallejo is the old man who \n had a fight with the captain of the \n Grand Titus, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_3_2,"I'm related to Lucienda-sama by blood. \n But I don't look anything like Lucienda-sama at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_6_1,"It's Mr. Vallejo, the engineer. \n He has a somewhat similar atmosphere to Mr. Hollow, so \n I remember him well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_1_1,"In order to summon the wise men, \n we need to fix the equipment in the conference room as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_1_2,"Let's go to the Lagi Snowfield."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_5_1,"I see.The way we met back then has led us here...\nThe guidance of the pendulum of fate is amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_4_1,"Ah...I replaced the broken wrench with a shiny, high-tech wrench\n When we talked about what a waste it was..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_1,"It seems that the old engineer \n knew that the equipment in the conference room was broken, so did we need to go and ask him?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_2,"Even if you leave it alone, it will come eventually."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_3,"It's an emergency right now, so \n you can't say that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_3_1,"Mr. Vallejo, we knew from the beginning that the device was broken."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_3_2,"In that case, I think you can fix it as soon as you gather the materials \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_1,"I'm glad \n that I can get what I need for repairs soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_2,"Now, {pc}.\n The first task for the hero and his ally."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_3,"It's fine that we get along, but \n don't forget that we are here."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_4,"Hehehe.\n We are important friends.\n Of course we all rely on you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_1_1,"If Mr. Vallejo already knows \n where the equipment in the secret conference room is broken, then it's time to talk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_1_2,"Defeat the killer machine and get the magic lens \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_5_1,"Now that I think about it, when I met Mr. Vallejo before, he was worried about the equipment at Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_4_1,"If I remember correctly, you did \n something like this before going to Rendersia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_4_2,"Let's finish this quickly and go back to finding Rendersia's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_2_1,"I got the magic lens, so let's quickly deliver it to the conference room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_3_1,"If you have a magical lens, you can repair the device."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_3_2,"Let's go to the conference room quickly! Mr. \n {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_6_1,"Once the equipment in the secret meeting room has been repaired, \n you can finally try to master the hero's secret techniques. \n Let's prepare to take the test."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_1_1,"Let's go to the conference room with the magic lens!\n Mr. Vallejo should have arrived as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_5_1,"Mr. Vallejo is heading to \n Gran Zedora Castle once he is finished preparing, so \n we should also go to the secret meeting room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_4_1,"I can't believe that such a strange glass plate would be useful for repair work...\n It's not cool at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_6_1,"The time has finally come to learn \n the secret techniques of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_6_2,"Can I leave it to \n {pc} to decide which Sage-sama's trial to start with? \n I want you to decide."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_2_1,"Finally, we can begin the \n trials to make the princess stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_2_2,"...I think we can also train ourselves by protecting the princess, so I'm looking forward to it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_1,"The device in the secret conference room can \n project people far away and talk to them. It's amazing that you can \n repair such a device right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_2,"But Lucienda-sama \n Mr. Vallejo's Hiiba-san... \n Is this some kind of joke?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_3,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_1_1,"Lushenda-sama...?\n Even from my point of view, Lushenda-sama \n looks young...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_5_1,"...Huh?\n Did I just say that I saw the truth?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_5_2,"Uh...\n I...I can't answer anything from my mouth..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_4_1,"What is that device?! \n I don't want to be anywhere near something that could be useful!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_2_1,"Even if you think you won't be fooled by monsters' deceptions, you can still fall for \n tricks..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_2_2,"Being too confident in yourself may not be a good thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_3_1,"A technique to break through the deceit of monsters.... \n Anlucia-sama has mastered \n a difficult technique..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_1,"By discerning the truth or falsehood of things \n A technique to break through the lies created by monsters \n The Eye of the Hero''..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_2,"No matter how much power you have, \n if you are fooled by deceit, \n you will not be able to win the battle against the monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_3,"I think it will be useful \n in our future battles."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_1_1,"'Hero's Eye'...\n If Anlucia can master this, \n it will be reassuring for us too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_1_2,"Let's go to the \n monster fighting arena in the Arahagiro Kingdom of the true world! \n I'm sure there will be great trials awaiting us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_5_1,"What on earth is Broggen-sama's trial \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_4_1,"You're trying to deprive me of the pleasure of being ripped off with a lie... \n Do you have a grudge against me?!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_2_1,"...That guy named Berorin Man \n was quite a formidable enemy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_2_2,"There are only monsters prepared by the sage.\n Trial monsters are strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_3_1,"To me, real monsters and fake monsters \n look the same, but \n Anlucia-sama is amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_6_1,"Thanks to everyone, \n I was able to acquire the Hero's Eye''. \n Now I don't have to be afraid of deception anymore."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_1_1,"I can't believe you were able to \n defeat such a formidable monster with \n Anlucia's cooperation..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_1_2,"The power of a hero and his ally is immeasurable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_5_1,"It's truly a secret technique to break down \n a fake that is indistinguishable from the real thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_4_1,"I don't understand how you can go out of your way to see through something that is more useless than the real thing.\n It's a fake!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_2_1,"The old man in Eidos is a poison test...\n The one in the Poison Fang Room seems creepy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_2_2,"I need the princess to clear the trials and become even stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_3_1,"I wonder if it's a test using poison...?\n It feels kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_6_1,"'Hero's Shield'... It's a technique that protects not only me but \n {pc} and everyone else. \n It would be very reassuring if I could learn it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_6_2,"I have already experienced how difficult it is to fight alone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_1_1,"Between poisonous fangs...sounds dangerous.\n I'm worried about being poisoned, but \n Let's keep our heads together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_5_1,"Maybe in the Popora region of the Pukland continent...\n I never thought I would return to Pukland for the trial of the evil-destroying technique."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_4_1,"The Poison Fang Room! What a wonderful name! \n There must be a lot of helpless junk lying around \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_1,"...Hey {pc}.\n I was able to acquire the Hero's Shield'', but \n I really wanted to say something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_2,"At that time, all my thoughts about wanting to learn techniques\n disappeared somewhere\n and all I thought about was protecting everyone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_3,"I was able to realize once again that the desire to protect one's friends \n gives birth to such great power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_4,"I want to be able to protect more and more people.\n That is my role as a hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_2_1,"That guy from Anlucia, after overcoming the trials \n he really became stronger..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_2_2,"We also want to emulate Princess Anlucia and become even stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_3_1,"Fighting a poisonous monster was \n scary, but Anlucia-sama protected me \n so I could fight with peace of mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_1_1,"If we didn't have Mr. Anlucia's Shield of the Hero,'' \n we would have been attacked by the monster's poison."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_1_2,"The power of the hero \n is great after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_5_1,"No matter how much you train your body, \n it's difficult to overcome poison, so \n I'm sure it will help you in your future battles."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_4_1,"Well, it was a nice cave full of poison! \n It would have been better if there were some junk, but \n I'll forgive you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_2_1,"The hollow old man\n I bet he was found by the Demon King's minions..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_2_2,"If that's the case, Hollow-sama is \n in danger! \n Let's go find him right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! It's tough! \n Let's go to Mr. Hollow quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_1,"That Hollow-sama looked so flustered... \n Something might have happened."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_2,"{pc}!\n Hurry up and find Mr. Hollow!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_3,"...But where are you? \n The last time I met you was \n on the Earth Ark..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_1_1,"I'm more worried about Hollow-sama than about the trial."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_1_2,"Even though he's a wise man, he's still an old man. \n I'd be worried if he got caught up in the trouble. \n Let's go find the old man!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_5_1,"Mr. Hollow looked as if he was \n fighting with someone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_5_2,"As Milt-san said, \n it would be better to check on Mr. Hollow's safety."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_4_1,"Isn't it just that the device is broken again?\n If that's the case, don't try to repair it this time.\n Is it okay if I take it for you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_2_1,"...There's also the Anlucia trial, and \n I need Sage Sama to stay healthy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_2_2,"He's a grandpa, so \n I was really worried..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_3_1,"Even the wise man could get hurt \n. \n I was worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_3_2,"You were your usual energetic enamel-sama. \n {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_6_1,"Share your heart of courage with your friends\n The secret skill of drawing out great power, Heart of the Hero''...\n I want to learn it no matter what."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_6_2,"Raising the power of your allies is \n the perfect secret technique for us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_1_1,"I'm relieved that Hollow-sama is safe.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_1_2,"...There is no guarantee that the Great Demon King will not interfere..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_5_1,"I'm glad that Hollow-sama was uninjured and seems to be doing well \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_5_2,"I heard that the trial of the secret skill of destroying evil will be held on the top floor of Rinja Tower in the true world. \n Let's head there too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_4_1,"I'm making you guys worry.\n Actually, you're fine, you're such a bother!\n I'm starting to like you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_1,"I was able to acquire the Heart of a Hero'' thanks to \n you, my ally, and everyone \n fighting together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_2,"Even if I am called a hero, \n there is a limit to what I can do by myself.\n This trial made me realize once again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_3,"But, I thought that if we all combined our \n powers, there would be no enemy \n that we could not defeat."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_4,"From now on, let's all work together and fight \n the army of the Great Demon King!\n Nice to meet you {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_2_1,"...The enamel old man is \n really a free and wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_3_1,"I feel like my heart has become \n stronger than it was before the journey began! \n Thanks to everyone and {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_1_1,"When I see Anlucia overcome her ordeal and become stronger\n, I feel motivated too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_5_1,"Share your heart of courage with your friends...\n It's much more amazing than I imagined.\n It's truly a secret technique only available to the brave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_4_1,"A magical statue that confuses people! \n I would rather have that \n than a secret technique!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_4_2,"Oh no, it's just too much of a hindrance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_6_1,"{pc}.\n When you are ready, take the next trial."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_2_1,"Hurry up and take the next test.\n The wise old men are waiting for you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! \n I wonder what kind of test we will face next? \n I have to do my best to become even stronger!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_1_1,"Unlucia-san's power will lead to \n defeating the Great Demon King, so \n let's hurry up and take the next trial!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_5_1,"There are still trials left, so \n Princess Anlucia can become even stronger. \n We can't afford to lose either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_4_1,"I don't want to use the sage all the time, but \n It's not bad to be able to see rare things. \n I'll keep going!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_1,"...I once wanted to become an ally of the hero Toma-niisama and support him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_2,"But the truth is that I am a hero and my brother supported me.\n And my brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_3,"But now {pc}.\n You and my friends are here as allies.\n That's why I can still fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_4,"As a hero, I will defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora and free Touma-niisama.\n Until then, I will never give up."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_5,"Stay by my side until the end. \n {pc}…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_2_1,"...Did Milt give the prince's body to \n the demons...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_2_2,"It's unforgivable, but \n he must have had his own \n conflicts..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_3_1,"Milt-san was so worried that he wanted to hand over the body to the demons and cling to the dead Prince Thoma."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_1_1,"I can't take advantage of Milt's \n sadness after losing his precious friend...! \n I can't forgive him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_5_1,"I once tried to bring \n my father back to life with the power of the wish-fulfilling notebook, so perhaps I don't have the qualification to say \n anything..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_5_2,"However, \n I will never allow you to use the sadness of losing a loved one for your own ambitions!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_4_1,"Even a seemingly talented person named Milt was actually a piece of crap who would be fooled by demons."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_4_2,"But you're useless and trying to beat me is 100 years too soon!\n You're coming back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_2_1,"Do I have to go to the trouble of \n a prayer ceremony to go to the place where the Tenkan is sitting?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_2_2,"Being a priest is tough."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_3_1,"If you use the purification spark dropped by the Twisted Torch, \n the door to the Throne of Vow will open."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_3_2,"It feels strange that the fire dropped by monsters is helping the high priests."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_6_1,"I thought {pc} would help the High Priest \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_6_2,"Besides, the Dharma Temple is \n one of the most sacred places in Rendarcia, so it might have something to do with the Scarlet Stone of the Gods."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_1_1,"It seems that the priests are not free, so \n we should bring the spark for purification."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_5_1,"The purification spark is said to be necessary for the Dharma Temple ritual, so \n let's do what we can to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_4_1,"It's an inconvenient place where you can't open the entrance unless you prepare the tools and perform the ritual! \n I've reconsidered it a bit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_2_1,"Let's deliver the spark of purification to High Priest Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_3_1,"This is the \n spark of purification that the High Priest needs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_3_2,"Let’s get it quickly! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_6_1,"Come to think of it, I…\n As the princess of Granzedora, I didn’t greet the high priest\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_6_2,"Last time you seemed busy with the appointment ceremony, so \n I had to give you a proper greeting when I handed you the spark of purification."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_1_1,"Now that I have obtained the spark of purification, \n the High Priest will be able to \n perform the prayer ceremony."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_1_2,"Let's go back to Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_5_1,"It's a blue, gentle fire... \n As the name suggests, \n it seems to have a mysterious power that cleanses impurities."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_4_1,"Even though fire is a free thing, \n it can be useful for many things, but \n I'm not interested in fire needed for important rituals!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_2_1,"If Dharma's divine object is really the divine scarlet stone, \n the dream that Grand Priest Sama had \n I hope doesn't actually happen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_2_2,"If we go to the Vow Seat, \n we might be able to stop it. \n Let's go."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_3_1,"Dharma's divine body wanted to \n tell the high priest \n that he was in danger through his dream?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_3_2,"Even though I can't talk to you directly, \n I can see it in my dreams and let you know. \n As expected of a deity."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_6_1,"Maybe my hunch was right.\n I'm also curious about the high priest's dream.\n Let's go to the ritual room in the basement of the temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_1_1,"To have a dream in which the High Priest \n destroys Dharma's divine object...\n is somehow ominous."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_1_2,"Let's go check out the deity."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_5_1,"Indeed, the Dharma Temple is a suitable place to protect \n the Scarlet Stone of God."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_5_2,"After all, Dr. Rossum said that \n it is a keystone that protects the land of Rendersia from evil beings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_4_1,"Are you going to a place where there are things that are cherished by everyone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_4_2,"If you have some junk, \n you can take it with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_2_1,"It's not easy to go to the Throne of Vow when it's so strictly controlled."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_3_1,"It seems difficult for monsters to enter \n the Seat of Vow unless the high priest performs a ritual \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_6_1,"Let's go to the Seat of Vow too.\n If we have the God's Scarlet Stone, we have to pour \n the power of the hero into it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_1_1,"Dharma's sacred object may really be \n the Scarlet Stone of God. \n Let's go to the Throne of the Vow as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_5_1,"If it is necessary to perform such a ritual just to enter the throne of the Divine Vow\n then the scarlet stone of the god may be the object of worship."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_4_1,"Is the ritual over? \n In that case, let's go see if there is any junk in the place called the throne of prayer!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_2_1,"I don't think you would go to the trouble of disguising yourself as the High Priest Sama and get in our way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_2_2,"Where is the real High Priest Sama...?\n We need to find him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_3_1,"The high priest who was disguised as a monster \n looked just like the real thing, so \n I didn't notice it at all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_6_1,"I'm glad I arrived in time to restore \n the power of the Age of Gods to the divine scarlet stone of the Dharma Temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_6_2,"Now we just have to make sure the high priest is safe. \n Let's go look for him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_1_1,"A monster disguised as a high priest \n was deceiving us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_1_2,"I'm worried about the safety of the real high priest! \n Let's find him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_5_1,"I can't let my guard down at all for a monster disguised as a high priest to perform \n a prayer ceremony."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_5_2,"The battle would have been dangerous if Princess Anlucia had not mastered \n'Eye of the Hero.''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_4_1,"It's a pain to enter, but \n It's a terrible room with no junk! \n The Dharma Temple is full of things like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_6_1,"{pc}.I'll say it now, but\nThe battle with the Phantom General was tough.\nI was so busy that I was dizzy because of the Phantom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_6_2,"But I'm glad we were able to protect the Scarlet Stone of the God of Dharma Temple\n.\n The High Priest was safe too, so we'll be fine now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_2_1,"After making the High Priest Sama immobile, \n I can't believe you're going to make it so that no one can see her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_2_2,"That monster was quite cautious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_3_1,"I'm relieved that the real High Priest has been found \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_3_2,"You're trying to switch places with the high priest\n You're a cunning monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_1_1,"Thanks to the god Granzenis entrusting the \n stone to the god Dharma, \n we have been protected and have survived."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_1_2,"Let us be thankful for the friendship of the gods."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_5_1,"The High Priest is safe and \n the god's scarlet stone has regained \n its power from the age of the gods, so it's a relief."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_4_1,"It's a pity that the object of worship is not a piece of junk, but \n it's a memento of a friend of the deities, so I can't be so stingy with it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_1,"King Sama is as careless as ever. \n I'm concerned about the God's Scarlet Stone, but \n With the way things are going, I feel like I have no choice but to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_2,"But a shattered mirror cannot be repaired."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_3,"For now, why don't you go to the fake Arahagiro Castle \n? \n You might find something similar."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_3_1,"King Moonis is so clumsy that even I get worried sometimes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_6_1,"I wanted to ask if King Moonis knows anything about the Scarlet Stone of God."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_6_2,"But I wonder if there is a replacement for the special mirror \n kept in the treasure vault of the Arahagiro Kingdom...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_1_1,"The same mirror may be stored in the treasure vault of Arahagiro Castle in the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_1_2,"Isn't it worth \n to go?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_5_1,"It seems that the Arahagiro Kingdom is in \n financial trouble due to the war, so \n King Moonis must have been in a panic."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_5_2,"As a prince, \n I cannot leave the suffering people of other countries alone. \n Let's go find the mirror of the phantom sun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_4_1,"That means you can't use the broken mirror anymore, right?\n I'll take it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_1,"It's good to know that the mirror that King Moonis broke is \n in the false world of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_2,"I can't believe a monster took it away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_3,"Looks like we have no choice but to look for \n the Bone Knight that the treasure room keeper told us about."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_3_1,"The same mirror existed in the false world of Arahagiro too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_3_2,"If we recover it from the monsters and give it to you, \n King Moonis will feel at ease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_6_1,"I have mixed feelings about the fact that the false world created by the Great Demon King can help save the people of the true world\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_6_2,"Anyway, we have to recover the Mirror of Phantom Sun from the Bone Knight in the Arahagiro region of the false world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_1_1,"Looks like the Bone Knight \n took the mirror away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_1_2,"Fortunately, the mirror I got back said \n that I can do whatever I want with it, so let's go find the Bone Knight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_5_1,"The kingdom of Arahagiro in the fake world was ruled by \n Bermud, so it can't be helped that the country would be in chaos after his death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_5_2,"I wonder if the people guarding the treasure house were also tired due to the domestic turmoil..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_4_1,"Does that mean that the treasure in the treasury has become \n junk because no one needs it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_4_2,"Hmm...but it's a treasure, so someone might want \n someday... I'm at a loss as to whether or not to get it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_2_1,"I need to take \n to King Moonis quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_2_2,"Aren't you crying by now because the minister is pestering you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_3_1,"Dear {pc}! \n Let's deliver the mirror to King Moonis!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_6_1,"Will I be able to use the mirror of this false world to put \n into the true world's hidden treasure? \n I tried to retrieve it, but I'm a little worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_6_2,"I think \n the Scarlet Stone of the God may be in the Sun's Stone Chamber where the treasure is hidden."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_1_1,"I was saved because there was a mirror like \n in the false world of Arahagiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_1_2,"If this mirror is unbroken, \n we might be able to enter the Stone Chamber of the Sun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_5_1,"I'm glad we found the same thing as the broken mirror. \n This is a problem that affects many people living in the Kingdom of Arahagiro in the true world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_4_1,"If I bring you a mirror, will you give me \n some junk in return?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_2_1,"Is there a mechanism in the pyramid that reacts to dancing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_2_2,"{pc} Can't you dance properly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_3_1,"{pc}'s dance...\n I might really want to see it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_6_1,"I see there's a mechanism that reacts to dancing.\nI wonder if the person who made it liked dancing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_1_1,"I think {pc} would be able to \n dance without being shy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_5_1,"If there is a God's Scarlet Stone in the Sunstone Chamber, \n monsters may attack. \n I'm worried about King Moonis and others who went there first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_4_1,"Is this a pyramid where treasure is hidden? \n I'm not interested in ordinary treasures, but \n Old junk is most welcome!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_2_1,"...Wouldn't it be no good if the king of the country, Sama, sold the \n God's Scarlet Stone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_2_2,"I thought \n that if it would make the country and people rich... \n That's a difficult problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_3_1,"I'm glad King Moonis and I found Shiny Melon \n. Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_6_1,"I'm glad that I was able to protect \n the Pyramid God's Scarlet Stone \n with everyone in 『Shield of the Hero』."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_6_2,"I never thought \n that King Moonis would want to sell \n the God Scarlet Stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_1_1,"Your ancestors left a treasure \n to your descendant, King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_5_1,"Like King Moonis's ancestors, I want to be able to \n extend a helping hand to my descendants when they are in trouble."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_4_1,"I've been looking for some good junk, but it doesn't seem to be there!\n You just have to get out of a place like this quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_6_1,"If you leave the rest to King Moonis\n, everything will be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_6_2,"That's what your father said before. \n King Moonis is a good king who takes \n his country seriously..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_2_1,"I hope that by growing shiny melons, \n the Arahagiro Kingdom's finances will be restored as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_2_2,"If it's a king like King Moonis who cares about the people, it'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_3_1,"I wonder what Shiny Melon tastes like \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_3_2,"Let's all eat together sometime! Mr. \n {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_1_1,"I want to try Shiny Melon too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_5_1,"King Moonis' \n good fortune until he obtained the treasure was probably bestowed upon him by his ancestors."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_5_2,"In addition to Shiny Melons, \n King Moonis' ancestors also gave us \n treasures."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_4_1,"I thought you were a piece of crap like breaking a mirror, but \n you were trying to protect the world...\n I was fooled too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_2_1,"It's a problem that \n people can't come to the hot springs because of monsters..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_2_2,"Even though I came here to rest my body, \n I can't stay in the hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_3_1,"Even monsters make me want to take a bath in a hot spring..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_1,"Gal...Anyway, \n I'm worried that some people will be attacked by monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_2,"And there must have been \n an old shrine in Montserro Hot Springs Valley... \n The Scarlet Stone of the Gods might be there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_3,"Maybe the monster that appeared was aiming for \n the Scarlet Stone of God?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_1_1,"A hot spring...\n Sometimes I want to relax and relieve the fatigue of my travels.\n"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_5_1,"If monsters remain in the hot springs like this, \n other people won't be able to use the hot springs, and \n Luzina-san won't be able to do her job as a manager."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_5_2,"Let's go to the hot springs quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_4_1,"I was really disappointed in the former Potsucon 2 who helped people over and over again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_2_1,"They're really laid-back guys who don't want to take a dip in a hot spring before fighting."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_3_1,"I want to go to a hot spring too...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_6_1,"We cannot let God's scarlet stone be crushed!\n {pc}! Let's hurry to the shrine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_1_1,"Since we have to deal with multiple monsters, \n this time it would be better to watch \n the opponent's movements more than usual!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_5_1,"It was a monster that talked nonsense, but \n the way it carried itself when it ran away \n wasn't normal."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_5_2,"Be careful and follow us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_4_1,"A place like a hot spring that heals people and even cleans them \n is not a good place!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_4_2,"Quickly defeat it and leave \n from here!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_2_1,"Now that we've defeated the demons that are the Great Demon King's minions, let's hurry back to Yakup's old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_2_2,"...The steam and heat will make you sweat even more."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_3_1,"It's full of monsters. Enjoy the hot springs\n It's so sneaky!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_1,"………………."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_2,"Oh {pc}?\n Sorry. It's nothing.\n I was just thinking..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_3,"More than that, I'm glad we were able to protect \n the Scarlet Stone of the Gods at Montserro Hot Springs Gorge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_4,"Even the Great Demon King Madesagora \n cannot touch the God's Scarlet Stone, which is protected by the power of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_5,"...Even so, the two Akuma generals were \n formidable enemies. In many ways..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_1_1,"I defeated the monster that came to the hot spring. \n Let's go to Yakup-san and report \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_5_1,"I was able to defeat the monsters and pour \n power into the God's Scarlet Stone, \n so other people can also relax in the hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_5_2,"Let's go to Meln Watermill Village and tell Mr. Yakup about what happened at \n the hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_4_1,"It healed the body and had sacred stones...\n It was an unpleasant hot spring that was useful for people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_6_1,"Now that Luzina-san has reminded me of \n my role as the guardian of the hot springs, I can safely entrust \n the Scarlet Stone of God."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_2_1,"... Yakupu's old man \n If you open his mouth, he'll only talk about gals."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_2_2,"...Well, if that's what makes you feel competitive about living, \n that's fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_3_1,"In the past, the guardian of the hot springs protected \n the Scarlet Stone of the Gods, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_3_2,"Thanks to the guardians of the hot springs, \n the Scarlet Stone of God and the hot springs are still \n cherished."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_1_1,"The scarlet stone of God will continue to protect \n for a long time..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_1_2,"As Luzina trains \n a successor, \n history will be woven again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_5_1,"As the successor of the Megistris Kingdom, \n I have to learn more..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_4_1,"Not only is it useful, but there's water all over the place \n The hot springs are already a mess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_6_1,"We were finally able to regain the \n power of the three remaining God Scarlet Stones. \n Let's go back to report to Lady Lucienda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_2_1,"...We managed to protect the remaining God's Scarlet Stone \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_3_1,"The enemy monsters were all strong, but \n we also became strong, so we were able to protect the God's Scarlet Stone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_1_1,"The monsters that tried to destroy the God's Scarlet Stone were all powerful enemies that could not be defeated without \n Anlucia's power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_4_1,"I was so useless that God somehow protected me, but since I found all kinds of junk, I will forgive you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_5_1,"I'm glad I was able to protect all three of the remaining Scarlet Stones of the Gods \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_5_2,"I hope this will stop the erosion of the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_1,"The pendulum of fate may be broken, but \n that doesn't mean our destiny is broken as well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_2,"As Lucenda-sama said, \n You must create your own destiny!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_3,"'Let's head to Solaria Canyon right away. \n I'm sure something is going on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_4,"If fate is \n heading in the wrong direction, let us guide you \n to the right path!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_2_1,"You demon lord...\n I'm sure he's not planning something \n that isn't even Roku..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_3_1,"The pendulum of fate has been broken..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_3_2,"You're taking away all of our efforts..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_1_1,"You are planning to block our path by destroying the pendulum of fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_1_2,"Let’s go to Solaria Canyon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_4_1,"A broken pendulum is useless!\nThen why don't you give it to me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_5_1,"...Let's go to Solaria Canyon. \n Where the Pendulum of Fate led \n before it was destroyed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_5_2,"Even if the pendulum is broken, we have no choice but to \n follow the path shown."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_6_1,"That deceptive object floating in the transformed Solaria Canyon... \n I need to investigate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_6_2,"It's okay.\nWhatever fate awaits us, we should be able to\n face it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_2_1,"...What is that creepy thing? \n Last time I came here, \n nothing like that was floating in the sky."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_2_2,"The terrain has changed \n to something ominous... \n Let's keep our guard up and move on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_3_1,"Dear {pc}...\n I'm scared of Solaria Canyon right now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_3_2,"But since you and {pc} are here, I'll do my best..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_1_1,"It's different from the previous Solaria Canyon...\n There's a sense of unease here."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_1_2,"I'm scared, but for everyone's sake \n I have to go...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_4_1,"What is that?! That place in the sky looks like there might be junk! \n You should go there quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_5_1,"What is that \n deceptive object floating in the sky?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_5_2,"...It seems better to proceed \n carefully from here on out."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_6_1,"You will not be defeated by the fear lurking in your heart.\n I will help you again and again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_6_2,"I'm the same way. No matter what fear stands in my way, \n as long as you're by my side, I'll be fine. \n So {pc} let's fight without giving up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_2_1,"Hey! {pc}!\n I'm sure you understand, but\n I'm not going to lose to the embodiment of fear!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_2_2,"Let's defeat that guy who just looks like \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_3_1,"Even if something scary appears to me, \n {pc}-sama, \n I believe that you will not lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_1_1,"Even if I show you the appearance of Hades Nergel, \n {pc} will not be afraid of \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_1_2,"You better not take us lightly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_4_1,"Former Potsukon No. 2, you can get over your own fears. It's boring, even if you're a person, I know that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_5_1,"{pc} can \n overcome that fear! \n Absolutely...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_2_1,"Damn it...!\n We're almost there until the Great Demon King\n Why are you being hindered by a barrier like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_1,"I want to defeat the Great Demon King right away, but \n it's impossible unless I break the barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_2,"After all, we can't move forward here unless we borrow \n wisdom from Lucienda-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_3,"...It's very sad to have to come all this way and start all over again, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_3_1,"If we don't enter the Demon Palace, we won't be able to defeat the Great Demon King!\n Dear {pc}, I'm frustrated...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_1,"The power of the Great Demon King is immeasurable for him to be able to manifest the fear hidden in your heart into a monster like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_2,"But you didn't give in to that fear.\n And I and everyone else are with you.\n I'm sure you can defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_3,"But before that, we have to do something to \n create a barrier to protect the Phantom Palace... \n Let's talk to Lucienda-sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_1,"Is there \n junk in the Great Demon King's castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_2,"If that's the case, \n we'll break in right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_3,"There's a barrier and I can't get through it. \n I'll talk to Lucienda, so \n I'll go back to Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_5_1,"You cannot defeat the Great Demon King unless you destroy the \n barrier that blocks your path to the Great Demon King's throne."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_5_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle.\n I'm sure Lucienda will be able to give me some advice."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_2_1,"Pegasus...? \n Does such a creature \n exist in this world?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_2_2,"You may have only heard about it in fairy tales."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_1_1,"It would be reassuring if the sages of the Crown of Wisdom could \n locate \n Pegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_1_2,"Finding a Pegasus that we don't know may exist... \n It's like catching a cloud..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_3_1,"Does Pegasus really exist?\n If so, I would really like to meet him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_1,"...Hey, {pc} is worried about whether Pegasus will actually be found \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_2,"I strongly...strongly believe that Pegasus will \n appear before us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_3,"Because the ally mentioned in the legend \n has really appeared and is still \n by my side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_4,"If Pegasus, your allies, and your \n friends lend you their power, \n even the Great Demon King will not be your enemy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_5,"There must have been some progress in the investigation.\n Let's listen to Lady Lucienda's story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_4_1,"Are you looking for a horse that can fight bad guys and fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_4_2,"That horse...\n It would be nice if it was a flop.\n It seems like there's little hope..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_5_1,"If we don't find Pegasus, it seems unlikely that we will be able to \n break the barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_5_2,"Even Lady Lucienda seems to be doubting the existence of Pegasus, so it looks like it will take a long time to find it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_1_1,"If you can ride the flying dragon using the dragon flute that Mr. Crows gave you, you can go to the island of Etene, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_1_2,"But riding a flying dragon...\n You're talking about Pegasus.\n You mentioned another amazing creature."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_2_1,"It's a flute that controls flying dragons...\n The Crows guy has \n everything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_2_2,"Earlier, a musical instrument craftsman on the beach of Kokorata was asked by a person named Kuro to make a special flute... Could that be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_3_1,"We're going to \n the island of Ethene on a flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_3_2,"I wonder what kind of ride the Hiryu is like?\n Will I be able to ride it properly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_6_1,"Pegasus is healing the \n scars from his previous battle with the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_6_2,"...No. I'm also interested in Pegasus, but \n I need to find the wyvern first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_4_1,"It's the hometown of the former Potsucon No. 2, so \n I'm sure there's some good junk here!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_4_2,"Please guide me properly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_5_1,"Looks like the only way to land on the island of Ethene is to fly \n through the sky..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_5_2,"There's no other option.\n I'll blow the dragon flute that the Crows gave me and get \n the flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_1_1,"Let's go to \n Wyvern Peak to find your partner, the wyvern that Mr. Wandora said \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_2_1,"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of flying dragon \n will be attracted by {pc}'s whistle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_3_1,"I wonder what kind of flying dragon will come...\n I hope it's a kind flying dragon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_6_1,"I will ask {pc}\n you to play the dragon flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_6_2,"I...\n I'm not good at playing musical instruments."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_4_1,"Former Potsucon No. 2!\n The flying dragon you call should definitely be\n a bare flying dragon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_4_2,"I would like to refrain from riding a bare dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_5_1,"Pegasus and the flying dragon...\n It's too late now, but I feel like I've stepped into a fairy tale."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_5_2,"We've even met the fairy tale hero\n Zankrone.\n It's nothing surprising, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_1_1,"I didn't think {pc}'s flute tone was \n terrible, but \n Hiryu and us feel it differently."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_2_1,"It looks like that white dragon will give you a flying dragon\n, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_2_2,"The sound of {pc}'s whistle \n seems to be pretty bad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_3_1,"The sound of {pc}'s flute...\n I didn't notice it though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_6_1,"You're such a rude dragon that the tone of {pc}'s dragon flute is boring or harsh!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_6_2,"If that doesn't work, \n If I blow it, \n I don't know how much people will criticize it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_4_1,"You made that annoying whistle sound.\n As expected of a former Potsucon No. 2! \n I've reconsidered you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_5_1,"Does that mean that the white dragon was \n interested in {pc}'s strength? \n It didn't seem to like the sound of the flute..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_5_2,"Let's go back \n to Mr. Wandora, the dragon protector. We have to check out the \n good thing that the white dragon sent us earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_1_1,"I never expected the white dragon from earlier to \n give me such a magnificent egg..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_1_2,"I wonder if you \n trusted us unexpectedly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_2_1,"...Amazing \n It's the first time I've seen a flying dragon egg."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_2_2,"I wonder what kind of person is inside the egg\n I hope to meet you soon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_3_1,"Having a dragon from an egg means \n the born flying dragon is \n a baby, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_3_2,"We are your parents.\n Can I take care of you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_6_1,"If the egg is that big, \n will the newly born flying dragon be able to carry all of us \n and fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_1,"Did that white dragon give us the flying dragon egg \n?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_2,"Since you said it was good, \n I mistakenly thought you were going to give me some really nice junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_3,"Former Potsucon No. 2. \n Do you have any other gifts?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_5_1,"I never thought the dragon king would bring us \n dragon eggs..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_5_2,"I didn't like his bossy attitude, but \n Maybe he was a surprisingly nice guy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_1_1,"Warm up the egg with the dragon flame stone and have the dragon show its face to you as soon as possible.　"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_1_2,"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of girl she is!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_2_1,"It's a tough job to be a Dragon Guardian, \n to have to live in such a rugged and inhospitable land."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_3_1,"Dragon Flame Stone sounds like a very hot name. \n I wonder if the egg will be boiled..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_6_1,"Now that you have collected the dragon flame stones, all you have to do is go back to Mr. Wandora's house and hatch the dragon egg."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_4_1,"A warm stone that can hatch eggs...\n I don't even want to use it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_1,"I wonder how hot it is inside the egg heated by the dragon flame stone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_2,"It's enough to hatch an egg.\n Isn't it a good temperature for a flying dragon?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_3,"It's so hot that the Hiryu \n might jump out."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_1_1,"Even though it just hatched from an egg, \n that flying dragon is doing really well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_1_2,"If you can fly that high in the sky, \n I think you can reach the island of Ethene \n in no time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_2_1,"It looks like Hiryuu is enjoying \n the outside world for the first time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_3_1,"The adult wyvern was scary, but \n this newborn baby is \n so cute!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_6_1,"It looks like you're \n attached to that boy {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_6_2,"Come on. \n Let me call you by blowing the flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_4_1,"I hate such useful creatures that can carry people and fly right after birth!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_4_2,"Even the Chilean guy \n When he was a baby, he was useless, crying all the time \n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_5_1,"It felt so good \n to fly in the sky... \n I'm a little jealous."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_1_r7000,"The height and ride comfort are different from Kamushika...! \n This may be the first time \n I've looked down on the ground from such a high place...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_2_r7000,"If you look down that far, \n you'll fall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_1_r7000,"It's a little unstable, but...\n The ride quality of the Hiryu is surprisingly not bad."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_2_1_r7000,"This is my first time flying this high in the sky."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_1_r7000,"I haven't told anyone yet, but \n It's me. My dream was to fly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_2_r7000,"Ever since I saw the picture of the hero riding Pegasus in a picture book read to me when I was little, I’ve always admired you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_3_r7000,"I never thought I would be able to fly through the skies on a flying dragon before Pegasus!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_4_r7000,"All that's left is to find Pegasus and fly side by side with him.It'll be even better!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_4_1_r7000,"Get me off here! \n It's Kanben who rides a useful creature!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_5_1_r7000,"It's this high...I'm worried about falling\n, but it's kind of fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_1,"I like the wind I feel at the height of the dragon because it feels good \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_2,"Fuura, that looked like fun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_1,"I was worried at first, but \n Hiryu seems to trust us completely."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_2,"Let's go show \n that guy to Sage Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_2_1,"That wyvern guy... he's so smart\n He seems to understand what we're saying.\n He's reliable!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_1,"Now that you can fly through the sky on a flying dragon, \n let's go back to report to Lady Lucienda. \n ...Now you can finally meet Pegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_4_1,"It was terrible to be carried by a useful flying dragon, but I could see a scene in the distance that looked like there was \n junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_5_1,"I'm sure Lucienda-sama will \n welcome the flying dragon, so \n let's go to Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_3_1,"Pegasus... where is he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_3_2,"I don't think it will be easy to find, but \n you won't have to spend too much time \n looking for it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_1_1,"The search for \n Pegasus will now begin in earnest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_1_2,"In order to defeat the Great Demon King, we must quickly find \n Pegasus!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_2_1,"The day will come when I will travel on a flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_2_2,"When you travel with {pc}, you never \n get bored."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_1,"The island of Ethene in the inland sea of ​​Rendersia...I wonder where on the island \n Pegasus heals wounds?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_2,"I hope that you have regained enough power to fight alongside Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_3,"It was \n a long time ago that Pegasus and the previous hero fought against the Great Demon King, right? \n Then wouldn't it be okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_4_1,"Wherever the former Potsukon No. 2 goes, \n there is usually \n junk that I like!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_4_2,"I’m going to go find a flying horse\n for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_5_1,"We're landing on the island of Ethene...\n There's not much information about Pegasus, but \n We'll definitely find it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_2_1,"In order to bring Pegasus back after it turned into a turtle, \n that Tenth Flower is needed, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_2_2,"This is getting a bit complicated \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_6_1,"The guardian deity of your hometown, the Turtle, was the current form of \n Pegasus..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_6_2,"It must be fate to have a connection with \n you, the hero's ally, in a place like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_3_1,"The turtle was a Pegasus...\n Unless Mr. Crows explains it to you, \n you'll never know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_1_1,"If we don't return the turtle to Pegasus, \n we can't go to the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_1_2,"First of all, let's look for the \n Tense flower that Mr. Crows mentioned. \n There should be a clue to it on the island of Ethene."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_5_1,"To return the turtle to Pegasus \n Find the lost Tenth flower..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_5_2,"Mr. Crows' words are very mysterious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_4_1,"I like the current turtle even though it seems useless!\n Is it no good as it is now!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_2_1,"I thought \n came here to look for the Tenth Flower... \n Is this {pc}'s brother's butt wipe...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_2_2,"Issho's old man, you're all right, aren't you?\n Well, I guess I'll have no choice but to bring you some rainbow-colored pyroxene\n as a nuisance fee."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_3_1,"It's wrong for {pc} to get \n angry instead of {pc}'s brother \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_3_2,"Issho-san doesn't seem to be willing to listen to me, though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_1,"I guess you have a brother after all.\n I kind of understand that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_2,"Yes...When I talk to you, \n I can't put it into words clearly, but \n I get the feeling that I have a brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_3,"Also, as Isshou-san said, \n I'm not the kind of person who would repay a favor in an additional way."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_4,"I would like you to tell me what your brother is like someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_1_1,"...It's not {pc}'s fault, but \n {pc}'s brother is involved. \n I guess we'll have no choice but to resolve it ourselves."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_1_2,"When I heard Mr. Issho's story, \n you are amazing brothers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_5_1,"Mr. Isshou is \n understandable to be angry, but Mr. {pc} is paying \n an inconvenience fee..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_5_2,"I wish there was some other way, but \n for now, it might be better to find the stone and give it to you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_4_1,"It's great to meet \n the brother of former Potsucon No. 2! I wonder what kind of \n wonderful trouble he's going to cause me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_2_1,"If you bring the rainbow-colored pyroxene, \n Isshou's old man will be satisfied."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_3_1,"If I give you the rainbow-colored pyroxene, \n Issho-san will probably forgive you, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_6_1,"I got the trouble money for Mr. Issho. \n Now, can you tell me something \n about {pc}'s brother?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_1_1,"Rainbow-colored pyroxene...\n It's a beautiful stone that doesn't look like \n should be treated as a nuisance fee."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_5_1,"They're asking for a precious stone as a nuisance fee, so \n I shouldn't keep you waiting.\n Let's go back to Mr. Isshou's house."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_4_1,"Is this stone a substitute for a trouble fee?\n I don't hate the word "nuisance", but\n I'm not interested in a sparkling stone like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_6_1,"Even though it's about {pc}'s brother \n 60 years ago, it seems confusing, \n Let's hear the story in more detail."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_2_1,"Issho's old man is worried that his daughter and {pc}'s brother were being chased by \n some dangerous guys."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_2_2,"I feel like I can \n understand your desire to test us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_3_1,"Mr. Isshou is very kind and \n family-oriented..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_1_1,"As a father, Mr. Isshou also \n tried to protect his daughters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_5_1,"My daughters were being chased by dangerous debt collectors. \n It's no wonder they suspected us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_5_2,"Mr. Issho seems to know \n the whereabouts of Mr. {pc}'s brother, so \n let's listen to him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_4_1,"I was angry and asked him to pay me for the inconvenience, but he started saying that he wasn't really angry.\n I don't understand him. He's an old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_2_1,"For the sake of Isshou's old man, \n somehow find \n {pc}'s brothers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_2_2,"This happened 60 years ago...\n It seems like a difficult story..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! Let's let \n Mr. Issho meet your daughters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_3_2,"I'm sad that I won't be able to see my family \n for a long time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_6_1,"Sixty years ago, \n Mr. Flasco lived in Gran Zedora Castle Town...\n First, let's ask him about that person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_6_2,"It's okay. \n I'm sure someone knows something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_1_1,"You never know when a person's life will end \n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_1_2,"I understand very well \n Issho-san's desire to see his family after he left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_5_1,"It's heartbreaking that I won't be able to see my family until I die.I feel for my family.\n I want to fulfill Mr. Isshou's request."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_5_2,"I will interview Mr. Issho \n in the Kingdom of Granzedora so that he will not regret it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_4_1,"Chili has become a great person, but if I never see you again, will I regret \n when I die?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_4_2,"You will definitely regret it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_2_1,"I thought {pc}'s brothers and Lilior were \n bastards for sure, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_2_2,"Maybe he's a nice guy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_3_1,"Mr. Flask, you've passed away.\n Mr. Issho, you must be sad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_6_1,"It was 60 years ago after all...\n I might be lucky if there were other people \n who seemed to remember what happened back then."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_1_1,"It was unfortunate that Mr. Flask, who was my reliable friend, had passed away, but \n I was able to hear some useful information from Mr. Salmar."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_1_2,"It would be nice if Daira remembered \n the past..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_5_1,"Mr. Flask had passed away, but \n his grandson, Mr. Salmer, knew \n the story of that time, which was helpful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_4_1,"Was your brother an excellent guy who also helped others?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_4_2,"You're betraying my expectations by making me think you're a piece of crap.\n You look exactly like someone!\n Hey, are you the former Potsucon No. 2?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_2_1,"I never knew that {pc}'s brother was an alchemist."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_2_2,"You alchemized drugs and you got melazo fever.\n You saved a lot of people, right?\n Aren't you big guys?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_1,"Dairah-san also knew \n the man in the suspicious sunglasses."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_2,"It seems like \n they were persistently chasing Lilior-san and the others across the ocean, so I wonder if those two are still safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_3,"I feel like I'm still doing well\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_1,"Perhaps because we were being chased by a suspicious man, \n we had a hard time reaching {pc}'s brother and Lilior-san's location."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_2,"But I feel like I'll get there soon.\n My ring is very accurate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_3,"Don't rush, let's look for \n based on the information we have so far."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_1_1,"I can't believe you have \n the power to save many people...\n Brothers look alike."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_1_2,"You're a wonderful brother that I respect!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_5_1,"Could {pc}'s brother and Lilior-san be able to alchemize \n drugs because \n they were researching plants...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_4_1,"The brother of the former Potsucon 2 was \n the kind of person who could help someone in trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_4_2,"You'll like it even more than the \n impression you got when you heard it from the old man who paid the nuisance fee!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_2_1,"The key to the Tenth Flower is \n Isshou's old man holds the \n key."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_2_2,"Let's go get \n that key quickly so that the old man doesn't forget it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_1,"I'm glad Lilior liked the rainbow-colored pyroxene pendant\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_2,"I'm sure Mr. Issho would be happy too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_3,"I'm starting to want to \n meet my father too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_6_1,"Isshou-san and Lilior-san \n, I'm glad we were able to reconnect \n with our bond."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_6_2,"Let's report to Mr. Issho and ask \n about the key to the flower that was sent to him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_1_1,"The rainbow-colored pyroxene was originally used for \n Lilior's pendant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_1_2,"I'm glad that Mr. Issho and his son were able to \n bond once again across time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_5_1,"What did {pc}'s brother entrust to \n Issho?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_5_2,"If it leads you \n to the Tenth Flower, you should \n hurry up and accept it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_4_1,"You remembered the gift for your daughter, but you forgot about the important letter."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_4_2,"The old man named Isshou was actually a bit of an idiot...\n That's really good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_6_1,"Until I find what I'm looking for, \n Issho-san, let's take your word for it and take a walk \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_6_2,"I would like you to tell me about the island of Ethene where you lived...\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_2_1,"Isshou's old man must have been keeping \n something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_2_2,"I just hope \n that Mr. Isshou hasn't thrown it away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_3_1,"Mr. Issho, it's been a long time since I last heard \n your daughter's story.I'm glad to hear from you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_1_1,"...No matter what happens, the bond between parent and child will never be broken..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_1_2,"I'm sure my father is also \n worried about me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_5_1,"Isshou-san seems relieved to know about Lilior-san's current situation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_4_1,"He was a bad guy when he thanked us, but\n he left his precious letter alone.\n That old man loved it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_2_1,"What is that pig? \n I told you to go find the pearl of the wind \n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_3_1,"I can't imagine what a pearl of the wind is...\n Will the wind blow if I touch it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_6_1,"There are pigs that can talk!\nIf possible, I'd like to help you find what you're looking for..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_1_1,"I have never heard of \n the Pearl of the Wind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_5_1,"Mr. Issho said that the letter he entrusted to you contained something like \n a pearl..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_5_2,"You may have found the letter by now, so why not check it out?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_4_1,"What that pig needs is \n The Pearl of the Wind seems to be valuable! \n I want you to search for something more worthless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_2_1,"The pearl of the wind in the letter \n is the one who said earlier that the pig was looking for it \n, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_3_1,"Hana-chan asked you to bring \n the Pearl of the Wind, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_3_2,"It might be something important, so let's give it to Hana-chan quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_6_1,"The key to the Tenth Flower is the pearl of the wind that the pig was looking for...? \n What does it mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_1_1,"Give Hana the \n Pearl of the Wind given to you by {pc}'s brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_1_2,"Maybe she knows something \n about Tensu flowers."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_5_1,"The pearl of the wind that was in the letter is the item that \n Hana-san wanted..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_5_2,"I'm also interested in the boy Mr. Issho mentioned \n, so I think it would be best to give him \n to Mr. Hana right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_4_1,"I don't think I can understand \n that pig who wants such a valuable pearl!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_2_1,"Hana will guide you \n to where the Tensu flower is."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_2_2,"You're a solid pig."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_3_1,"It's finally time to return the turtle to Pegasus \n You can see the Tenth flower!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_1,"I guess all you have to do is wait \n for the pig to fly in the wind hole in Lazea."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_2,"...What? \n Are you flying away? A pig...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_3,"How does it fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_1_1,"Let's wait in front of the rock door in Lazea's Wind Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_1_2,"I feel like I can finally meet \n the Tensu flower..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_5_1,"If the flower in Hana-san's words is \n the Tenth flower... \n Let's hurry to the rock door of Razea's wind cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_4_1,"Is it the Wind Cave of Lazea?\n It sounds like there might be some good junk in there\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_2_1,"For the sake of \n {pc}'s brother who alchemized the Tenth Flower, \n the Great Demon King must be defeated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_3_1,"{pc}'s brother \n has worked hard \n for {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_3_2,"I'm jealous of you \n for having such a kind brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_6_1,"Even though {pc}'s brothers are apart, \n they have always been thinking about you. \n The brightness of the tenth flower seems to represent that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_6_2,"In order to respond to those feelings, \n let us fulfill our mission!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_1_1,"{pc}'s brother \n paved the way for the Tenth Flower with his own hands..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_5_1,"A shining tenth flower that I spent my life alchemizing. \n We cannot let the fruit of that effort go to waste."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_4_1,"I was looking for what kind of junk \n my brother, the former Potsucon No. 2, has, but it seems like he doesn't have anything good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_6_1,"The time has finally come for the turtle to regain his \n Pegasus form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_6_2,"It's almost time to borrow the power of Pegasus and break through \n the \n barrier of Great Demon King Madesagora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_2_1,"Hana's guy... \n He finally finished his job \n He looked relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_2_2,"I've been waiting \n for a long time for {pc} to come. \n Let's let him get some rest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_3_1,"I hope Hana-chan can spend some time relaxing \n from now on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_1_1,"With Hana-san's guidance, I was able to obtain \n the Shining Tenth Flower."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_1_2,"The only thing left to do is to \n return the turtle to his original Pegasus form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_5_1,"To be able to create a creature like Hana-san..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_5_2,"Your \n brother {pc}'s skill as an alchemist was very good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_4_1,"I'm not interested in a \n pig who has completed his task to the end! \n I can take a nap and take it easy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_4_2,"Are you trying to \n take care of Hana-chan in your own way, Duston-san?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_3_1,"The appearance of Tenma Falchion \n It was so beautiful, Mr. {pc}! \n I was impressed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_6_1,"If you borrow the power of Tenma Falchion, you will definitely be able to break through \n the Great Demon King's barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_6_2,"Now, let's head to the twisting, strange land\n of Solaria Canyon, which has changed...\n to the castle of the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_2_1,"Having come this far, Crows was \n a different person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_2_2,"The original Shin-yi seems to be \n kind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_1_1,"Wow...\n I've never seen such a beautiful white horse..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_1_2,"This looks exactly like \n for a hero to ride."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_5_1,"Mr. Shinyi...?\n I'm also curious about what he has to do as Mr. Crows on his back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_5_2,"However, \n I would like to thank \n you for leading us to this point."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_4_1,"I liked turtles that stayed still\n, but now they turn into horses with wings!\n I want them to return to their original form!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_4_2,"The current appearance of Pegasus is \n its original appearance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\n We were able to break the barrier!\n Now we can go to the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_6_1,"As expected of Tenma Falchion, \n I couldn't break that barrier with my heroic power alone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_6_2,"While you support us so that the barrier that opened \n does not close again, \n let us go inside!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_2_1,"The power of Pegasus is amazing...\n It has broken the barrier that did not budge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_2_2,"Well, it's finally the decisive battle. \n Let's go! {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_1_1,"We were finally able to \n break the barrier to the palace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_1_2,"Now, let’s go defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_5_1,"Tenma Falchion was able to break such a strong barrier..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_5_2,"I can't go with you to the Great Demon King, but \n I'm sure he'll support you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_4_1,"That horse called Pegasus...\n He can fly and destroy barriers.\n He's an excellent guy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_4_2,"I've never seen a horse that looks so good and is so good!\n I don't want to get close to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_2_1,"The palace is full of \n monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_2_2,"This is the castle of the Great Demon King.\n The air also feels stagnant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_1,"Heroes and allies...\n And let's combine everyone's power to defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_2,"...I won't let my ally Sama do all the cool \n. \n You can have high hopes for me even before my wedding."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_3,"Don't expect too much from me!\n I'm confident in my ability to be a jerk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_4,"It's just like that...\n But if it's just like usual, \n I might feel relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_5,"I've come this far because I'm with you all.\n I'm not worried now.\n ...Now, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_1_1,"That's an annoying number of monsters...\n Let's quickly take care of them and hurry to the Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_3_1,"In the past, I would have been so scared\n that I would have lost my footing, but\n now I'm fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_3_2,"So {pc}! \n Please watch my fight!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_5_1,"There are a lot of \n monsters in the palace as it is home to the Great Demon King. \n If you're not careful, you might get unexpectedly injured."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_4_1,"I want to meet \n junk, not monsters!\n Monsters are a nuisance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_2_1,"If I lost to the Great Demon King's minions, \n I wouldn't have the face to match \n to those who believed in me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_2_2,"...That’s why I will never \n kneel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_3_1,"We will definitely defeat the Great Demon King!\n We will face you again and again!\n Hey! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_6_1,"Demon Marshal Zeldorado...\n As expected, he is not an easy opponent..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_6_2,"But we will stand up again and again and protect this world.\n Let's go! {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_1_1,"The power we have cultivated on our \n journeys so far... \n We will put it to full use!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_5_1,"Today, we have \n a strong will and a sense of mission to defeat the Great Demon King! \n Mr. {pc}! Let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_4_1,"I lost to the great demon king's henchmen...\n This kind of clumsy behavior is not the kind of clumsyness that \n I like."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_4_2,"Come on, former Potsukon No. 2! Once again \n I'll go to that subordinate! \n I'll show you my ponkotsu power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_2_1,"Damn it...!\n Where did the Great Demon King Yarrow disappear to!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_3_1,"If we don't find the disappeared Great Demon King quickly, \n the Great Demon King's plan will be completed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_3_2,"Are Falchion and Anlucia somewhere in \n the Temple of Light? \n Let's look for them, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_1_1,"The Great Demon King wasn't in the palace...\n I feel like I'm being made fun of. \n I'll definitely find him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_5_1,"An evil person called the Great Demon King is seeking the spiritual core of creation, going so far as to obtain \n the power of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_5_2,"I don't know how bad it is, but \n we have to stop it before the Great Demon King gets his hands on it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_4_1,"Now that the Great Demon King is gone, does that mean I can take over \n the junk that was in the palace?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_1_1,"I can't believe I'm stuck in the barrier left by the Great Demon King...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_1_2,"...Anyway, let's go find \n the magical power of creation. \n The evil cave of creation was the false island of Ethene."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_2_1,"If you come here, you will be blocked by the barrier again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_2_2,"...The Great Demon King is \n an annoying bastard!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_3_1,"Demon King...I can't forgive you for always getting in our way!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_1,"The Great Demon King is using \n Touma-niisama to open the gates of the abyss...\n The power of the hero..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_2,"I won't let that happen.\n I can't let Touma-nii-sama become a \n tool of the Great Demon King's ambition any longer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_3,"In order to break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor, let us fulfill Falchion-sama's request!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_5_1,"We must break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor\n and rush to the gates of the abyss.\n First, let's obtain the magical power of creation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_4_1,"I don't know if it's a garden or a pillow, but \n I think there's some unknown junk behind that gate!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_4_2,"Come on, former Potsucon No. 2!\n I’ll make sure you get to the gate as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_2_1,"I have obtained the magical power of creation.\n Will this be able to break the barrier of the Temple of Light...\n Now, let's return to Pegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_3_1,"This is the magical power of creation...\n I wonder what it is... Even though it's a power that comes from a monster, \n I feel a strange warmth..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_3_2,"Ah! By the way, {pc}-sama! \n We must return to the Temple of Light quickly before the Great Demon King’s plan goes forward!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_6_1,"Even while this is going on, the Great Demon King Madesagora should be steadily approaching\n the gates of the abyss in search of the spiritual core of creation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_6_2,"Let's hurry and deliver \n the Mystic Goblet to Lord Falchion in order to break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_1_1,"If you have this magical power of creation, you can break through the \n barrier and go to the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_1_2,"Let’s return to the Temple of Light!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_5_1,"If you bring back the goblet filled with the magical power of creation to Lord Falchion, \n you can finally defeat the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_4_1,"I'm always forced to do things that are useful...\n Sometimes it's of no use to anyone\n Please let me suffer!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_4_2,"You can't shake until something like this, old man...\n After you blow up the demon king's bastard, \n you can do whatever you want, so be patient."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_2_1,"I've been stuck a lot, but...\n I'm finally able to blow away the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_3_1,"The Great Demon King is scary, but \n everyone is here for me, so \n I can move forward...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_1,"We were finally able to break \n the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_2,"I can't let Toma-nii-sama become a tool of the Great Demon King's ambition any longer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_3,"I may not be able to do it with my own strength, but now everyone is by my side.\n I will definitely stop the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_4,"Come on {pc}.\nLet's hurry and aim for the end of the Eternal Corridor.\nOur final battle awaits."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_1_1,"The power of the hero Anlucia and \n her ally {pc} was necessary to break \n the barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_1_2,"Now, let's go beyond the \n Eternal Corridor to stop the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_5_1,"As expected of the power of a hero and his ally...\n It's amazing that you were able to break such a strong barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_4_1,"I'm tired of being shown \n the superior qualities of the princess and the former Potsukon No. 2, but if there is \n junk ahead of me, I'll give it to you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_2_1,"...Was that a hallucination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_2_2,"There's no way my best friend \n is still alive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_1,"Was it just a hallucination?\n When I woke up, I was back in the junk castle.\n And what's more, Chili had turned into a baby."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_2,"Chili is just a useless cry.\n Everything is a mess.\n Oh no, it was so nostalgic!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_3,"I could have stayed a little longer, but \n the unseen junk of Rendersia is waiting for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_1,"It was \n a hallucination that your mother was alive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_2,"Even though I couldn't ride the Kamusha properly, \n my mother gently hugged me \n and comforted me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_3,"I'm fine now, but I just felt like I didn't want to leave you for a little while."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_1_1,"I guess what happened earlier was just a hallucination. \n I was playing training with Arold and Giganf when they were young..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_1_2,"I couldn't do the same rigorous training as adults, so it was just a game, but...\n It was nostalgic and fun..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_1,"I had a vision that I became the king of Megistris and was \n supported by my living father and mother…."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_2,"They were \n happy that I became king... \n They looked very happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_3,"I thought \n that I wanted to stay with these two forever... But I have to protect the real people of \n Megistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_4,"I will fight with everyone so that I can become a king that my father and mother can be proud of."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_1,"The store I was looking at was a \n weapon shop with an outstanding selection of items.What's more, it was a very generous store that would give you everything \n for free."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_2,"I thought that if I had a good weapon, I could help you even more\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_3,"I thought that even if I received a good weapon, it would be meaningless if I didn't become stronger myself.\n I kind of lost interest in it and left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_4_1,"I just went out to ask you to carry \n more junk than I could carry by myself, and \n it disappeared..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_4_2,"Not only is it junk, but it was a hallucination \n It's so useless that I like it, but\n It's a shame to have so much junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_3_1,"The hallucination I had was... Keki-chan shop!\n It was a shop that sold a lot of wonderful Keki-chan dolls\n!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_3_2,"It was a lot of fun, but...\n I thought the {pc} guys were gone, so I went outside the shop and they disappeared..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_1,"Did I just have a hallucination?\n When I woke up, I was in a big tailor's shop with my father and Arold."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_2,"Then they offered me \n all kinds of clothes. \n They said they would buy me as many clothes as I wanted."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_3,"I realized that it was just a hallucination, so I refused because the battle with the Great Demon King Madesagora wasn't over yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_4,"However, one of the things that was recommended to me was \n a costume that looked like something a bride would wear... \n That was very beautiful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_1,"...The hallucination I saw was that people from other countries were giving away large amounts of money and \n treasures for \n Megistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_2,"I was worried for the sake of my people, and I remembered \n my father... so I refused."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_3,"Rather than relying on others for everything, I want to make Megistris a good country with my own hands."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_4,"I'm sure my father will \n approve of me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_2_1,"...I had a hallucination of being hugged by all kinds of women.\n It was so annoying that I quickly left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_2_2,"...What is it? {pc}.\n Unfortunately, I don't have the time to mess with women\n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_1,"Third hallucination...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_2,"Chili was a baby, and \n there was a lot of wonderful junk... \n Those are the only two things, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_3,"If there was such a thing as a third hallucination, \n it would have been such a boring hallucination that I don't even remember it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_3_1,"I had a hallucination where men were saying something that made my heart skip a beat...\n I was so embarrassed that I ran away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_3_2,"Ugh...I've never confessed anything like that before\n so I'm still really nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_1,"I had a vision of training \n in a battle royale with extremely strong people gathered on a mysterious isolated island!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_2,"Among them were Arold and Giganf...\n And my father was there too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_3,"There were a lot of other strong people I met on my travels so far.\n But for some reason, they were all men."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_4,"Huh? How did they come out?\n Of course I defeated them all and came out!\n Even though it was a hallucination, I feel like it was a good training session!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_5_1,"That... It was a hallucination of being praised by women I didn't know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_5_2,"I'm not very used to women, so \n I want you to stop pulling pranks like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_2_1,"Anlucia was able to join us safely.\n In order to defeat the Great Demon King, we need the hero Sama!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_4_1,"Finally, the princess has returned.\n Without the princess, I can't defeat the Great Demon King\n and collect junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_3_1,"I'm glad Anlucia-sama is safe...\n After all, we all have to defeat the Great Demon King\n, {pc}-sama!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_1_1,"Anlucia-san is back too, so it's finally time for the decisive battle with the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_5_1,"If we don't have the brave Princess Anlucia and \n our ally {pc} together, \n we won't be able to fully utilize our powers."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_5_2,"Now, let’s go defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_1,"Lord Falchion said \n that those who aim for the gates of the abyss will have their hearts tested.\n I can't believe that's what happened..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_2,"...That's right. \n Was something like that happening at {pc}? \n That was certainly painful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_3,"But {pc} and I \n never succumbed to such temptation. \n We can definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_2_1,"I'm just like Anlucia.\n There are people I want to protect in this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_2_2,"So that they can laugh and live their lives \n...I will absolutely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_3_1,"I'm not afraid. \n {pc}-sama and everyone else are here, so \n I can fight properly...''"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_3_2,"I won’t lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_6_1,"If we give up, \n the world will be the way the Great Demon King wishes... \n Let's go to the gates of the abyss once again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_6_2,"Release Brother Thoma\n and crush the ambitions of Great Demon King Madesagora\n this time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_1_1,"I gained a lot of power from my long journey with {pc} and others."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_1_2,"No matter how many times I lose, I will get back up every time!\nAnd I will definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_5_1,"The power of the enemy is still strong. \n But for the sake of the future... \n We will not give in!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_4_1,"Moki! \n {pc}! If we don't defeat them quickly, \n we won't be able to collect junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1,"Thanks to everyone, I was able to free Thoma-niisama from \n the spell of the Great Demon King Madesagora \n and was able to speak with him one last time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2,"...I have to tell Milt-san too.\n We witnessed the end of Touma-niisama...\n No. The last moments of the hero Toma."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1,"Finally, I was able to defeat the Great Demon King!\n He was pretty strong, so I think my armor has also improved \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1,"To think that I, along with everyone else, defeated \n the Great Demon King... \n I just can't believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1,"I want to inform Father and Arold that I defeated the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2,"I also want to tell my father and mother \n Uncle Nablett!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1,"As the Prince of Megistris, \n I am very proud to be able to defeat the Great Demon King with you all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1,"I want to be the most \n useless man in Astortia, so I helped \n exterminate the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_2,"From now on, you'll be helping \n find my junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1_flag10035,"{pc}...Thank you for \n fighting with me until the end."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2_flag10035,"Regardless of whether you're my ally or not, I'm really grateful to you.\n It's because of you that I was able to get this far."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_3_flag10035,"My mission as a hero is over, but \n I still have a big job left to do: protect this kingdom on Toma-niisama's behalf."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_4_flag10035,"I want to borrow your power from here on out, but \n I have a feeling that an even greater \n destiny awaits you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_5_flag10035,"But {pc} don't forget. \n Just as you were by my side, \n I'll be by your side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1_flag10035,"We were able to destroy the Great Demon King's plan. \n From now on, I guess the days will be peaceful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1_flag10035,"I'm glad you were able to defeat \n the Great Demon King for everyone living in this world! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1_flag10035,"Milt-san will continue to serve \n the country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2_flag10035,"I have to become even stronger so that I can \n protect everyone even if the next enemy comes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1_flag10035,"With the help of the talented Milt, \n I think the Kingdom of Grand Zedora will further develop \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_2_flag10035,"I also want to make the Megistris Kingdom a good country so that it can stand on par with the Kingdom of Granzedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1_flag10035,"It's a good thing \n to be able to focus on collecting junk now that the Great Demon King is gone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_2_flag10035,"Former Potsucon No. 2! Hurry \n Let's head to the next collection of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1_flag10035_out,"Since you're talking about {pc}, \n you'll continue to help people in need, right?\n Of course I'll help too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2_flag10035_out,"You don't have to worry, we have permission from your father, mother, and Lucienda. \n We look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1_flag10035_out,"Where are you going from now on?\n My journey with you will be training for the sword. \n I'm still planning on following you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1_flag10035_out,"Dear {pc}! From now on, I want to \n learn all sorts of things as we travel \n! So... please help me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1_flag10035_out,"I'm sure there are still \n people in Astortia waiting for our help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2_flag10035_out,"So {pc}! \n Please continue to take \n to all kinds of places!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1_flag10035_out,"As the heir to the throne of the Megistris Kingdom, I want to experience more things and learn how to protect the people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_2_flag10035_out,"So, Mr. {pc}\n, we look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1_flag10035_out,"Come on, former Potsucon No. 2! \n Oh no, {pc}! I'm going to look for \n junk all over Astortia!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_19_1,"Thanks to Mr. Zankrone's words, \n Laska seems to understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_19_2,"It would be nice if you could make up with Gash's uncle and return \n to your usual energetic Laska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_19_1,"Hehe. Grandma Kope loves \n Laska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_19_2,"While the grandmother is getting ready, \n let's go check out the watermill."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_19_1,"Thanks to {pc} and the others, we will be able to bring \n Grandma Kope back to \n the village as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_19_2,"I would like to meet \n Grandmother Raska and Gash as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_16_1,"Liz didn't listen to my words..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_16_2,"Still, in order to protect everyone \n I have to stop Liz!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_1,"Everyone calls her Queen, but \n Liz is just a normal child like the rest of us."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_2,"However, since everyone relies on Liz, \n she may also feel responsible and try to do something \n."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_3,"Let's go after Liz!\n Before something dangerous happens..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_1,"Liz was fooled after all.\n...But with that demon \n I can't do anything on my own."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_2,"Please! \n Please lend me your power again!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_3,"Well said!\n Even I feel bad if I lose.\n I'll beat you up with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_4,"Yeah!\n Let’s all do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_5,"Everyone...! \n Thank you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_1,"It was such a terrible thing to point a sword at a monster that had no resistance and had no resistance.I couldn't forgive it, even if it was against the king."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_2,"But \n I never expected to make people so angry...\n Thank you for helping me, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_3,"Because they are such kind people, \n I want you to see what is in the rocky mountains of Murud."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_17_1,"It seems that the monsters sleeping in the graves of the rocky mountains of Murud\n were friends with the demon master."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_17_2,"Mr. {pc}! I also \n want you to see the stone monument at the back of the grave! \n Let's go quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_17_1,"If I am really that killer panther's \n demon user, I can't leave her \n alone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_17_2,"Let's go to the Jaira jungle!\n There's a cross-shaped scar on my left eye\n If you find it, you'll know it right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_17_1,"I think the wary killer panther is \n hiding deep in the jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_17_2,"I was nervous about exploring the jungle by myself, so having everyone there was reassuring!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_1,"I want everyone in Arahagiro to understand that all monsters are not enemies."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_2,"For that purpose, first of all, let's go back to Arahagiro and make them aware of the existence of \n the Demon User!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_3,"Chome and I will prove to everyone that humans and monsters can \n communicate with each other!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_1,"Survival deathmatch...\n The lives of monsters entertain humans\n They're not tools..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_2,"I don't want \n monsters to suffer because of such a cruel event!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_3,"Let's hurry to the entrance to the \n monster fighting arena on the east side of Arahagiro! \n We have to let the monsters escape!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_17_1,"If we can successfully let the monsters in the fighting arena escape, we can cancel the \n event!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_17_2,"If you show your coffin to the soldier guarding the side entrance and tell him \n that you've captured a killer panther, \n he'll let you through the underground cage."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_17_1,"Please, everyone!\n Lend me your power to stop Bermud-san!\n That person should be in the battle hall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_20_1,"Thank you \n for taking on the role of escort for me, \n {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_20_2,"I'll \n closely follow {pc}, so don't worry about me and head towards Zedra Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_20_1,"The giant red dragon is scary, but \n I don't think my memories will come back if I just wait."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_20_2,"Just one more breath. \n Please go to the giant dragon's nest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_21_1,"If {pc} protects you, \n you don't have to worry about anything on your way to Kudus Spring in the Gyra Jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_21_2,"You are my lifesaver. \n I am counting on you."
