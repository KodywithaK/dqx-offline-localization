PT_TALK_TXT_3_10_2_1,"This is the Windy City Azlan, huh. It's definitely\npretty windy."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_10_4_1,"It's a small town, isn't it?\nI don't think there's much to be expected from\nsuch junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_20_2_1,"Successors and the like seem like a bothersome issue;\nnone of my business, y'know... {pc}, I'll\nleave that to you."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_20_4_1,"That young lady couldn't pass the exam\nShe's quite a talent!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_30_2_1,"Fuura... Maybe she's lonely like Somya."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_30_4_1,"That young lady hit eight points and dropped a doll.\nThere's still hope!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_2_1,"Hmph. Babysitting another brat... But I'm glad she\nsomehow has the guts to do things herself."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_4_1,"Oh my.\nI was thinking of giving you Junkie No. 3, but\nI was so disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_2_1,"...Can't be helped. Let me lend a hand. Oi, Fuura!\nDon't get too far away my side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_2_2,"Y-yes! Uuugh... Big brother is kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_3_1,"I have to do it! I have to finish this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_40_isJoined_4_1,"Now, I wonder what\nwill be in this tower?\nI'm looking forward to it!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_45_2_1,"Hmm. That Fuura girl looks like she's gotten more\nconfidence."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_45_4_1,"That mountain checkpoint\nwas small and seemed useless, but\nit was quite nice!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_2_1,"That Fuura girl has some guts!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_2_2,"U-um! Thank you, Hyuza!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_3_1,"I did it, Mother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_3_2,"Thank you, Azlantelopes..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_50_4_1,"It's not my preference, but\nthat monster seems to have his own\nstyle."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_2_1,"...You have to do it, don't you, Fuura. But this\njourney will be dangerous, you know?"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_2_2,"...I'm still a little scared, but it's okay! I want to\nprotect them. This town and the world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_3_1,"Thank you for your continued support!\nI will do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_60_4_1,"Once this is all over, I'd like to have a long talk\nwith that monster about what hobbies they got."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_1_1,"Is this Fuura's hometown?\nThe wind feels nice."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_1_2_1,"Wow, the wind is strong.\nIt's a pretty pleasant town, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_1_4_1,"It's a small town, isn't it?\nI don't think we'd expect to find a lot of junk there..."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_2_2_1,"The wind is still blowing in this town."
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_2_4_1,"I wonder what the monster is doing these days...I want to talk to him once and for all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_3_1,"Yeah! The wind isn't stagnant!\nLooks like it'll be okay even if we don't go back yet!"
PT_TALK_TXT_3_100_5_1,"Is this the town of wind?\nFuura's wind ceremony...\nI wanted to see it too."

PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_1_1,"Beautiful town... It's so different from our Ogre\ntowns, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_2_1,"...This is Royal City Kamiharmui, huh. Peaceful\nplace, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_3_1,"This is Royal City Kamiharmui! It feels bigger than\nAzlan."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_4_1,"In other countries, ya don't see many buildin's like\nthese, do ya? I'm hopin' it has some different junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_10_5_1,"Viewing the cherry blossoms planted in the city puts\none's mind at ease, does it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_1_1,"A royal curse? Wouldn't it be careless of the King\nto go to such a terrifying place on his own."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_2_1,"...Hmm. An abandoned castle, huh? There's definitely\nsome history there, isn't there."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_3_1,"That one from a little earlier, umm, Kyusuke?\n<br>\nJust when I thought I'd seen the last of him, after\nhe finally graduated the Garden of Learning, he just\nhad to be working here..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_4_1,"Hoho! An abandoned castle! *This guy* has high hopes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_5_1,"An incident in which the royal family died in a\ndisturbing manner... A sacred place that lost its\npower..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_20_5_2,"Why do you think Master Nikolai is going to such a\ndangerous place now, after 50 years?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_1_1,"Those kids... They didn't give off an impression of\nevil, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_2_1,"...What were those just now? Ghosts?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_3_1,"......"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_3_2,"Oi, Fuura! You look pale! Are you alright!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_4_1,"Great, ain't it! Even just an abandoned castle is\ntemptin' useless ghosts into lookin' at it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_23_5_1,"...What in the world was that just then? It felt more\nlike apparitions... Than some sort of vision, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_1_1,"...I'm worried about King Nikoroi too, y'know. For\nnow, let's go back to Kamiharmui Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_2_1,"...Just now, what the hell happened here? Definitely\nsomething unbelievable, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_1,"Wa-wasn't that a ghost!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_2,"...That felt like an illusion, right. It didn't\nseem like a ghost."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_3_3,"Th-then, that's fine, but... There's something you\nwant to tell me, isn't there? What is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_4_1,"Umm, good fer nothin'... It didn't feel like that,\ndid it. I don't like ghosts like that, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_30_5_1,"Th-that... Do you believe it was a vision of the\npast, like what we saw at my mother's villa...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_1_1,"A leaf from the Great Black Tree of the Cursed Lands...\nWould you really want something like that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_2_1,"...Cursed Land, huh. What kind of place is that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_1,"It'd nice to be of help King Nikoroi, but together\nwith Kyusuke..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_2,"You act like you know him; you an acquaintance or\nsomething?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_3,"We were studying together in the Garden of Learning,\nbut he slung some ineffective magic medicine that\nwould help one memorize the entire spellbook."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_3_4,"...I think that's terrible, but how do you know it\ndoesn't work?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_4_1,"That Kyusuke guy... He smells just like a Junkie,\ndon't he...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_40_5_1,"I do not believe that the vision was meaningless.\nI believe it was trying to convey something."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_1_1,"The roots of that big tree are growing everywhere,\ny'know. Let's proceed using that as a landmark."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_2_1,"Oi, wait a minute, he's not coming. Well, it's better\nthan dragging him around, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_3_1,"I'm glad Kyusuke isn't coming with us, but it makes\nme a little angry, you know. That stupid show-off～!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_4_1,"Rumor has it that even plants can't grow properly in\nthe Cursed Lands! A place like this, probably got\nsome lovely stuff lyin' around, ain't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_45_5_1,"Everyone, please take care. This land is contaminated\nwith demonic miasma; there are poisonous marshes\neverywhere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_1_1,"That leaf... It looked like it was waiting for\n{pc} to come, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_2_1,"...Even a place like this has guardians, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_3_1,"Those guardians... They looked a lot like the Spirits\nof Yggdrasil that I learned about at school...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_4_1,"Those leafy guys looked really useless with those\ndead leaves, didn't they!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_5_1,"The last remaining leaf fell as if it was drawn to\n{pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_50_5_2,"Does that mean that you were recognized for having\ndefeated those guardians?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_1_1,"That leaf... Do you really think it was a good idea to\ngive it to King Nikoroi? I got a bad feeling about it,\ny'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_2_1,"Heading back to that Abandoned Castle, again, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_3_1,"Eh! Kyusuke's going with us!?... Yuuuck."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_3_2,"We studied at the same school, didn't we? Have a\nlil faith in me."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_4_1,"Gufufufu. Goin' back ta the Abandoned Castle again,\nain't we? I'm lookin' forward ta it, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_60_5_1,"Because we were the ones that fetched the leaf of\nthe Great Dark Tree, it is our duty to see this\nthrough to the end, I believe."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_1_1,"So many scary illusions, aren't there..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_2_1,"...What's going on? Illusions are appearing one\nafter another. Is it because of the leaf of the\nGreat Dark Tree?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_3_1,"If what happened in that illusion was true, the Queen\nshould have recovered, but I wonder what happened...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_4_1,"I knew it, this castle is full o' lovely junk,\nain't it... Gufufufu!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_66_5_1,"As expected, these are illusions of the past...?\nWhat purpose do you think the leaf of the Great Dark\nTree has?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_1_1,"The Queen said she was sealed away? By King Nikoroi's\nolder sister?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_2_1,"Never would've expected that the supposedly dead\nQueen, was just put to sleep, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_3_1,"You mean that the Queen showed a vision to King\nNikoroi in order to protect the Sanctuary? The members\nof the royal family are amazing, aren't they..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_4_1,"Do we still got things to do!? Is it okay if I just\nadmire the junk around here?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_70_5_1,"...Is this the reason we brought the leaf of the\nGreat Dark Tree...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_1_1,"Since we all were responsible for delivering the leaf\nof the Great Dark Tree, I'm glad we were able to\nresolve things safely."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_2_1,"...That old guy, Kyusuke, had a good point and it\nwas nice of him protecting King Nikoroi, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_3_1,"Jeez! Again, Kyusuke ended up having a good point!\nHe's really a bit of a happy-go-lucky guy!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_4_1,"Bein' in this Sanctuary place sends a chill down\nmy spine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_4_2,"Being at the Sanctuary gives you the goosebumps...\nMr. Duston, you're not a monster, are you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_80_5_1,"Princess Rita... You walked the same path as my\nfather, didn't you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_1,"A lot of things happened, but Eltona's Sanctuary\nregained its power again, so I'm really glad, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_1_1,"Beautiful town... It's so different from our Ogre\ntowns, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_1_5_1,"Flowers dance in this town too; it reminds me of\nMegistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_1,"...Even King Nikoroi, with that demon off his mind,\nlooked refreshed, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_1_1,"I'm really glad we were able to protect this\nbeautiful town, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_2_1,"...Feels like the flowers are more graceful than the\ntimes we came here before, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_3_1,"Someday, I want Azlan to become a splendid town that\nrivals the Royal City"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_4_1,"I wanna go back to that Abandoned Castle again to\nadmire all the little junk, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_2_5_1,"I, too, like King Nikoroi, wish to protect my\ncountry."
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_3_1,"...Kyusuke! As always, he marches to the beat of\nhis own drum!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_4_1,"In the end, there was no ghosts, was there? Too bad!"
PT_TALK_TXT_4_100_5_1,"King Nikoroi, even after such things occurred,\nsupported this country, did he. I wish to become\nstrong like King Nikoroi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_10_3_1,"Wow, the ocean is so close!\nThe smell of the wind is completely different from the forest!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_10_4_1,"Is it the sea?\nI don't feel at ease when I'm covered in water like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_3_1,"What is Wendy's most important thing?\nI'm looking forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_4_1,"Ruins! What a sweet surprise!!\nLooks like there's some nice junk lying around!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_4_2,"Hey, are you also interested in\nold things?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_20_4_3,"I don't care how old it is.\nBut do you want to ride a boat?\nI'm not good on water!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_24_3_1,"Is Somya okay?\nI'm a little worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_24_4_1,"A kitten just meows.\nIt's useless.\nI kind of like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_3_1,"That man... is\nsomething important to Wendy, right?\nI wonder if he can fix something that big."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_4_1,"Are you going to fix that?\nIt's turned into a nice piece of junk..."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_4_2,"No, no,\nIf we don't fix it, we'll be in trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_26_4_3,"Then, while I'm touring the ruins, I'll look for\nother junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_30_3_1,"It was beautiful to see the sea being given holy protection\nby the power of songs of grace!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_30_4_1,"In the end, there wasn't anything special.\nSince it's called ruins, I was hoping for some excellent junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_40_3_1,"Somya...isn't she the girl from earlier?\nWhat's going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_40_4_1,"Cat... Hey cat...\nI hope it's useless when it's a kitten."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_50_3_1,"I'm going to throw the kitten into the sea!\nI feel sorry for him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_50_4_1,"Just meowing like that is useless.\nBringing a kitten home...\nThere's a lot to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_60_2_1,"Oh my god, it's a kid's weight."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_60_3_1,"Somya...? Let's do our best together!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_60_4_1,"Cats don't really collect\nthings...\nWell, I'll go without high expectations."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_70_2_1,"He knows the loneliness of not having a parent\nthe best.\nSomya will understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_70_3_1,"I don't understand how Somya feels...\nBut...I'm sure you'll get through it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_70_4_1,"There was nothing special about the junk!\nShumi is in trouble with cats!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_2_1," .......\nNo, it's nothing."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_3_1,"Somya and the kitten are safe, the town is saved, and we even got a key emblem.\nIt's a happy day!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_4_1,"It's okay to be thanked by the people of the town.\nI've often faced embarrassing situations like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_2_1,"Look, I already said goodbyes are best kept quick.\nLet's go already!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_3_1,"Mr. Hyuza...\nI'm a little surprised that you would\nsay something like that to Somya."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_3_2,"Noise.\nI'll leave it behind."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_100_Talkedto_4_1,"Next time, somewhere with more junk\nThat's good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_1_1,"It's a pretty nice town with a great view and a beautiful beach."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_1_3_1,"Wow! The sea is nearby! The smell of the wind is\ncompletely different from the forest!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_1_4_1,"I'm not good at sea, though."
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_2_1,"I wonder how Somya is doing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_2_3_1,"Somya, how are you doing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_2_4_1,"Thank you is no good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_6_101_5_1,"Is it the Ripple Tuning Fork from the Wedi Ruins...?\nI would love to see it."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_1_1,"A town with great views and plenty of water, isn't\nit. It's a big difference from Rangao Village where\nI've been living."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_2_1,"This is the town where the Queen sings songs of\nblessings, huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_2_2,"I can't help but hope that, someday, my name will be\nknown in this town too, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_3_1,"Wow! With all theses waterways running through town,\nit's a very pretty kingdom, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_4_1,"I can't relax wit' this water all over the place;\nwhat a town, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_4_2,"...No, no, this is just the kind o' town where there\nmight be junk I haven't seen yet. Former Junkie\nNo. 2! Let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_10_5_1,"Queen Diore, who rules this country, is said to be\nrespected by her subjects as an enlightened monarch.\nI, too, must follow her example..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_1_1,"What a beautiful song... There's no way someone who\ncan sing songs like that could be cold as ice, at\nleast I think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_2_1,"I heard rumors, but the song of blessings in person,\nhuh. Hearing it up close is amazing, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_3_1,"Wo... Wooow....... So pretty...."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_3_2,"...I'm really glad I didn't have to sing during the\nWind-Sending Ceremony...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_4_1,"The young lady bein' chased by that dog earlier...\nShe's got a junkie feel, don't she!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_4_2,"Mr. Duston, you were more interested in that person\nthan the Queen's singing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_13_5_1,"Queen Diore gives holy protection to the waters all\nover the country like that, does she. Amazing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_1_1,"Something astonishing... Or whatever he said. That\nwas purposely hidden in the maze, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_2_1,"...That guy was the Prince of my nation, huh. I like\nthat he doesn't throw his weight around, but I think\nhe's a little unreliable, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_3_1,"She must be an amazing fortune teller to predict our\narrival, right! I wonder if that person also heard a\nvoice from nowhere?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_4_1,"The young lady bein' chased by that dog earlier\nshould've forseen it as a fortune teller, ain't that\nright. Was my expectation wrong, y'think?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_20_5_1,"I cannot think of it as someone else's affair.\nI would like to help the prince."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_1_1,"I don't hesitate to helping people, but... That\nfortune teller...something bothers me about her."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_2_1,"Astonished is right... That girl, despite appearances,\nis still alive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_3_1,"Being involved in something like being imprisoned all\nthat time is sad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_4_1,"Umm, those underground ruins... There's probably still\nsomethin' to sink my teeth into, ain't there. There's\njunk I ain't see yet there, no mistakin' it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_30_5_1,"...A person like father who sacrificed herself in the\npast for her country... Don't you think?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_1_1,"Do you think the Queen knows about the girl from\nearlier who was trapped in the labyrinth...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_2_1,"The Queen and Prince on bad terms... Looks like the\nrumors were kinda true, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_3_1,"Do the Queen and Prince not get along, I wonder...?\nIt's hurts because his mom is healthy, they should\nget along, right..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_4_1,"I wanted to ask if I could take some junk from the\ncastle, but it didn't seem there was anybody to turn\nto, ya know."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_33_5_1,"Stating his opinion and not being listened too...\nPrince Odis' feelings... I feel as though I understand\nthem a little."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_1_1,"Since {pc} made the decision, we'll\ngo with you, but shouldn't you discuss this a little\nmore with your mother?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_1_2,"......."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_2_1,"...For a Prince, you've got a one helluva backbone,\ndon't you."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_2_2,"I'm sorry for being selfish. But I'm not a child\nanymore. I can't just do my mother's bidding forever."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_3_1,"I'm rooting for you, Odis. Do your best, okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_3_2,"Thank you. I am truly grateful to you all."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_4_1,"I'm bettin' a tropical ruin has junk I ain't seen before,\ndon't it! Kupupupupuh!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_40_5_1,"Would it truly not be best to search the ruins, once\nhe has inherited the throne?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_1_1,"There's even a guard here; as expected of a ruin\nconnected to the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_2_1,"...Hmm. That wasn't our enemy, but to have a guardian\nhere; it seems this is a very important ruin, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_3_1,"With that, Prince Odis has learned the song?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_4_1,"There's junk lyin' around all over the place; very\nlovely ruin, ain't it! It's a shame that it's too\nheavy ta take home!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_50_5_1,"It appears that Prince Odis has been successfully\nrecognized as a member of the royal family."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_1_1,"{pc}, let's go! We have no choice\nbut to stop the monster that was sealed away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_2_1,"...Oi, wait a minute. Isn't that monster that woke\nup when the seal was broken or whatever dangerous?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_3_1,"Waaah! Mr. {pc}, what should we do!?\nThey said the sealed monster is about to wake up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_4_1,"That young lady has a super junkie style! I knew\nthere was nothin' wrong with my eyes! I definitely\nwant her as my assistant, ya know."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_60_5_1,"Lady Diore, at first glance, appeared to be a strict\nperson, however... It is expected... She is a mother,\nafter all."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_1_1,"That fake fortune teller... She'd better not be up to\nno good anymore."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_2_1,"...It makes sense why that monster was called a tyrant,\nhe was dangerously powerful, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_3_1,"The Queen and the Seal Maiden were amazing, weren't\nthey."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_4_1,"Ahhhh... That junkie young lady's gone, ain't she.\nI thought I'd scout her, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_5_1,"That monster was liable to bring ruin to the world,\nonce its seal was broken; I was frightened, but\nthanks to everyone, we could defeat it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_70_5_2,"Was I able to be of some help too?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_1,"I wonder if that monster had something to do with\nthe Demon King too? We defeated it, so it doesn't\nmatter either way, does it."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_1_1,"I wonder what kind of powerful monster was sealed\nin this land?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_1_5_1,"Queen Diore, who rules this country, is said to be\nrespected by her subjects as an enlightened monarch.\nI, too, must follow her example..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_1,"...Prince Odis seemed to look pretty happy, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_1_1,"I wonder, has Celia properly acclimated to this time?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_2_1,"...Someday, I will accomplish something big by myself\nand make a name for myself!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_3_1,"Are the Prince and the Seal Maiden doing well, I\nwonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_4_1,"That Queen ain't my cup o' tea, y'know! The Prince\nguy is a bit promisin', though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_2_5_1,"Do you think Queen Diore and Prince Odis are on\ngood terms?"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_3_1,"I'm really glad that the Queen and Prince were able\nto reconcile, y'know. I hope that from now on he\ncontinues to cherish his mother, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_4_1,"Although it's ain't as good as that young lady's, the\nPrince of this country has a bit of a junkie style too;\nI kinda like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_7_100_5_1,"To not succumb to fradulent fortune tellers, I, too,\nmust be more dilligent!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_2_1,"The whole town feels tingly."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_3_1,"There's something a little scary about this town...\nEveryone is big, but\nIt's not just that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_10_4_1,"Mountains and rocks!\nI love these bare landscapes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_2_1,"Hey, hey...\nI thought you were suddenly thrown into prison.\nYou should help save the country, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_3_1,"If a war breaks out, everyone will be sad.\n{pc}, let's do something!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_20_4_1,"The prison was dark, damp, and smelled like mold...\nIt felt like they were telling me that you were a helpless piece of crap. It was great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_2_1,"The reason why the king of this country went crazy is because of that bastard named Nergel...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_3_1,"The Demon King... Hades... It's so scary... But!\nI decided to protect you!\nMr. {pc}! I'll do my best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_30_4_1,"Why go out of your way to\nlook for something useful!\nIt's a good thing to lose a broken bone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_2_1,"Sage Sama, I don't know what happened between you and that\nmonster, Oren, but\nshould I really take that Holy Grail?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_2_2,"...\nIt's fine for now. Don't worry about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_3_1,"Eidos, you look kind of sad."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_40_4_1,"Holy Grail? Something like that that seems useful is\nnot my thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_2_1,"...A dragon this time?\nReally,\nI never get bored when I'm with {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_3_1,"The terrifying dragon... is scary, but\nWe have to heal King Bagdo quickly!\nLet's do our best, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_50_4_1,"Are you going to go get something useful again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_2_1,"...He was quite a challenging opponent.\nIt was a good experience."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_3_1,"Wow, {pc}! That's amazing!\nWe defeated the dragon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_4_1,"I was hoping for\nsome of the water dragon's treasured junk, but\nthere wasn't any nice junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_2_1,"That wise old man left of his own accord, but\nAre you sure you can't heal the king with this?\nIf we fail, there'll be a war, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_3_1,"We must quickly restore King Bagdo and stop the\nwar."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_60_isLeaved_4_1,"If we get King Sama back, I wonder if you could show me some of the junk in the castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_1,"I'm glad we didn't have to waste blood between the ogres.\nThank you so much."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_2_1,"...A while ago\na war was about to break out?\nThere are a lot of people who look strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_3_1,"The ogres are big and a bit scary, but\n...they seem sincere."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_1_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2!\nCould you please ask the king to\nshow me the junk in the castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_1,"Even though various things happened,\nKing Bagdo was safely recovered\nAs expected of a wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_2_1,"This country has calmed down completely."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_3_1,"The people of Glen are returning to their daily lives as if nothing had happened.\nIt was really good..."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_4_1,"That magical miasma stone necklace\nis said to cause harm if you wear it\nIt's so stupid!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_2_4_2,"If you don't want it,\nI would have liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_3_1,"King Bugdo...he's healed properly!\nI'm really glad that the people of Guren didn't have to feel so sad."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_4_1,"Moki!! The king is thanking me.\nIt's so embarrassing!\nI'll go somewhere else as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_5_1,"King Bagdo is a gentle and honest king who\nhas a high reputation among the people, and\nI respect him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_9_100_5_2,"To try to manipulate King Bagdo into\nwar...\nI can't forgive him."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_5_3,"Yes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_2_1,"This is Gartland Castletown, huh. There are swarms of\nstrong-looking guys here."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_3_1,"This is Gartland Castletown, hmm. Surrounded by large\nrocks, it feels like an Ogres' town, doesn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_4_1,"Even this quality junk, they can't seem to understand;\njust an unrefined lot, ain't they!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_10_5_1,"The one ruling this town, King Grossner, is old, but\nhis subjects trust him deeply, and I, too, respect\nhim."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_2_1,"...Oi, wait a minute, {pc}! Be careful!\nBut that woman... Is no ordinary person, is she."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_3_1,"Th-that person is a sage...Yes? Her presence is\nsomehow different than the other sages, isn't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_4_1,"Losing your wallet, you really are a great junkie,\nain't ya. Yeah, having re-examined ya."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_13_5_1,"{pc}, I am glad your was not taken,\nI must say. Nevertheless, what an amazing lady..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_2_1,"...The strongest are disappearing? That's not why you\nset out on a journey with someone like me, is it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_3_1,"That sage uses healing magic, hmm. Despite appearances,\nshe has to be a kind person, right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_4_1,"Guys that can't fight like that oughta be left alone!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_20_5_1,"Strong people are disappearing... Could such a thing be?\nIt is a major issue for this country, nevertheless..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_2_1,"...Those two are really skilled people. I can see it."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_3_1,"Zama Beacon is that place with the big beacon that\nwe passed on the way, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_4_1,"It seems like it's okay ta take it slow in castletown,\nso let's go look for some junk or somethin'."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_23_5_1,"{pc}, let us go have a look. Somehow,\nI have a bad feeling..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_2_1,"...Oi, hang on, are you serious? I thought that Arold\nguy was supposed to be pretty skilled before, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_3_1,"Eh? Eh? He disappeared right before her eyes? What do\nyou think happened?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_4_1,"If junk disappeared, I'd be miserable, but a capable\nlooking ogre disappearing--doesn't concern me, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_30_5_1,"Never! Even Mr. Arold... What in the world is\noccurring, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_1_1,"I'm sorry for dragging you into this. But you all are\nthe only ones I can rely on..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_2_1,"Is that old Spindle guy really strong? Didn't seem\nlike it to me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_2_2,"King Grossner relies on him, so he used to be super\nskilled, but... Let's try to find Arold quickly\ninstead!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_3_1,"The sage seems to be stronger than that man named\nSpindle..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_4_1,"Pirate hideout!? There's gotta be some lovely junk\nthere, ain't there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_5_1,"The grave gift that was delivered to Glen Castle, that\nwas the necklace that you, {pc},\nmentioned before, yes?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_40_5_2,"Are you saying that that the incident then and the\ncurrent case are connected?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_1_1,"The trail ends here... Where could Arold be!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_2_1,"...Looks like that monster wasn't the mastermind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_3_1,"Poor Maiyu..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_4_1,"There wuz never any big piece of junk, wuz there!\nI'm so let down! Pugiiiiiii!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_50_5_1,"That monster... I concerned about what she had left\nus with, you see. Who do you believe it was that she\nhad found?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_1_1,"{pc}, please! Lend me your strength\nto defeat the Malynn and rescue Arold and the others!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_2_1,"...I thought that the sage was no ordinary person,\ny'know, but I never expected that she was the\nmastermind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_3_1,"The sage is a monster... Even King Grossner and Mr.\nSpindle have been kidnapped... What should we do!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_4_1,"Hmm...Came back ta life, wazzit. That was your reason\nfor being, right, former Junkie No. 2?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_60_5_1,"Malynn and Juliante were after one whom had been\nbrought back to life... That is, {pc},\nthey were searching for you...? To what end, I wonder..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_1_1,"A little while ago... That voice. Whose voice was\nthat, I wonder..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_2_1,"Tch! we missed one. Even that clown a friend of that\nmonster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_3_1,"I'm glad that Mr. Arold, King Grossner, and the others\nare safe too."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_4_1,"Mokii!! If we're gonna gather anything, we should be\ngatherin' junk, not soldiers!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_70_5_1,"The words that escaped monster left us with... What\nhe said was concerning, was it not..."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_1,"{pc}, everyone, I look forward to\nworking with you, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_1_1,"When I come here, I remember the time that I met\n{pc} and you guys, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_2_1,"There's as many strong-looking guys as ever. Sometime,\nI want to challenge them, heh."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_3_1,"All Ogres are big after all, aren't they. Heheh.\nBut we were the ones that saved this country, isn't\nthat right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_4_1,"It's full of rough-looking Ogres as ever, ain't it!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_1_5_1,"The one ruling this town, King Grossner, is old, but\nhis subjects trust him deeply, and I, too, respect\nhim."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_1,"...Is that okay? Leaving her fiancé behind."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_2,"I believe helping {pc} is what I need\nto do now. It's okay, Arold understands."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_2_1,"There's as many strong-looking guys as ever. Sometime,\nI want to challenge them, heh."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_3_1,"All Ogres are big after all, aren't they. Heheh.\nBut we were the ones that saved this country, isn't\nthat right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_4_1,"Still full of rough-looking Ogres, ain't it!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_2_5_1,"Looks like that monster friend, the clown\n, is no longer here."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_1,"Maiyu, did you hear the voice too? What'd it say?\nWhat'd it say?"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_2,"It said... What I told Arold earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_3_3,"I see. Anyways, I was wondering if it wouldn't say\nthe exact same things."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_4_1,"After alllll that, just another Key Emblem, huh; how\nhumiliatin'. I don't want somethin' like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_1,"Ms. Maiyu heard that voice as well, did she not.\nQuite like us all."
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_2,"That's right, y'know... I look forward to working\nwith you! Let's help {pc} together!"
PT_TALK_TXT_10_100_5_3,"Yes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_2_1,"This is kind of a carefree place, isn't it. Is this\nreally a place where I can show off my skills?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_3_1,"This is the town of Orphea! It looks like a really\nfun town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_10_4_1,"Nice vibes, ain't there! A town like this is bound to\nhave some junk to dig up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_20_2_1,"{pc}! You don't think that we can leave\nthings as they are, do you? Let's go see what the\ncircus guys have to say."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_20_3_1,"The children disappeared, but that was all part of\nthe magic act, right? They're okay, aren't they?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_20_4_1,"Where's the punchline, what a junk magic trick!\nThat ringleader has my sympathy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_2_1,"Whether there's a reason or not, I can't stomach\nkidnapping kids, you know."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_3_1,"It's terrible what happened, but everyone seems to\nbelieve in the Captain. I wonder if there's some\nreason for that...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_21_4_1,"That pilfering poppet... That's pretty good! I got a\nfeeling we'll have a new comrade!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_2_1,"Since we don't have any other clues, let's try going\nto that Silver Hill place."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_3_1,"Why do you think the mayorringleader would have\nkidnapped the children...? Let's try going to\nSilver Hill!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_30_Talkedto_4_1,"The stuff they said about a nobody like that guy...\nIt's embarrassing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_2_1,"Who does he think he is with that plan? That ringleader?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_3_1,"The Captain... He seems to have a reason after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_40_4_1,"That door's mysterious look's a bit interesting,\nain't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_2_1,"To protect the kids from that demon, he kidnapped and\nhid them? The mayor's pretty kind, isn't he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_3_1,"The Captain seems like a nice person after all!\n{pc}, let's help the Captain!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_50_4_1,"It's startin' to be a bit of a hassle, ain't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_2_1,"So that demon was the real culprit? All that's left\nis to get those brats back home. Let's hurry up and\ngo, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_3_1,"See, the Captain really was a good person after all!\nI'm sure the children are safe too! Let's hurry over\nto meet them!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_57_4_1,"That devil, Sigras, waited 15 years just to get\ndefeated; he was awfully useless, wasn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_2_1,"Tch, wouldn't it've been better if that ringleading\nmayor had told the reason from the beginning?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_3_1,"I'm glad all the children are safe. And since we\ndefeated the scary devil too, they can live happily\never after... I hope?"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_60_4_1,"That door... If was protecting the kids, ya can't say\nit was junk, can ya. I'm disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_2_1,"Hmph! That captain guy gave us the runaround until\nthe very end."
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_3_1,"The circus was fun, right! And we even got a key emblem,\nit was really great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_100_4_1,"Another Key Emblem! Please quit it! I'm not interested\nin them, not even a bit!"

PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_3_1,"This town has a similar feel to Cakey, doesn't it.\nI think it's really cute!"
PT_TALK_TXT_12_101_1_4_1,"It's a lively place!\nIn a town like this\nthere's bound to be some junk to find!"

PT_TALK_TXT_13_10_2_1,"...This is Megistris City, huh. Makes sense that\nit's called a city, because it's huge, right."

PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_1_1,"...She was a kind queen, wasn't she. But why did\nshe write her third wish in the notebook, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_2_1,"...What just happened? {pc}, you saw that\ntoo, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_3_1,"Queen Arwe looked so happy, so why do you think she\nwrote down a third wish...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_50_4_1,"I don't know what all that gibberish was about, but\nit looks like the wish grantin' notebook's real,\nain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_1_1,"...I can't forgive a monster like that Id! Let's\nhurry to the Ritual Hall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_2_1,"...Oi, wait a minute, the Hero's true form was the\nkingdom's prince, seriously!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_2_2,"...No. Now's not the time, we gotta blow away that\nbastard, Id!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_3_1,"Master Fostail was Prince Raguas!? And the lute was\nactually the Queen's Notebook... Eeeeeeeh!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_60_4_1,"...Even the disguised person forgot about that!\nThat's a beautiful junkie style!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_1_1,"We were able to stop Id's scheme, but it came at a\ngreat cost, didn't it... If only I had more power...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_2_1,"...For now, let's leave him alone."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_3_1,"The Queen used her third wish for Prince Raguas'\nsake, didn't she..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_3_2,"Just like my mother, she was such a kind mother,\nyou know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_4_1,"The notebook disappeared, but now that I think 'bout\nit, I don't need such a useful notebook!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_70_4_2,"Since collecting junk wit' yer own hands is the best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1,"I never expected someone like the Prince would\naccompany us, y'know. He said that {pc}'s\nfate is mysterious."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1_1,"...You've heard the story, but again, Prince Raguas,\nyou were great, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_1_2,"Yes. But now that I am with everyone, I am okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_1_5_1,"Father... Do you think I am any closer to becoming\na person worthy of being king?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_1,"...Raguas, you put on a good face, I tell ya. Well,\nwhile we're together, we'll protect you, so stick\nclose, okay."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_2,"Yes! I look forward to working with you all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_1_1,"Even though all those sad things happened, the\npeople of this country are strong. I cannot help but\nfeel a little stronger too."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_2_1,"...Despite the King's absence, things are calm, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_3_1,"No matter when one comes, flowers whirl in the wind;\nit's happy looking town, right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_2_4_1,"I wanna go ta that big windmill tower and look fer\njunk again, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_1,"I look forward to working with you from now on, okay!\nBut traveling with someone like a prince makes me a\nlittle nervous, you know."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_2,"Ms. Fuura, since we are traveling together as friends,\nit is alright if you only call me Raguas."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_3,"Still, I can't just call you that!... In that case,\ncan I call you, Mr. Raguas?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_3_4,"Naturally. In that case, from now on, please call\nme that, yes."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_4_1,"With Raguas' power, I can take the castle's junk,\ncan't I?"
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_4_2,"Umm. I do not believe there is any junk in the castle\nthat you, Mr. Duston, would be happy with..."
PT_TALK_TXT_13_100_5_1,"Please allow me to help in your battles as well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_10_2_1,"...This is Gatara, huh. Nice, lively place, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_10_3_1,"There's no one to give out the Key Emblem...? What\nabout that Junk Castle they mentioned, I wonder...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_20_2_1,"A phantom thief? Are you serious...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_20_3_1,"...Phantom Thief Poicrin?\nCool and cute..."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_30_2_1,"Huh...I don't get what's going on..."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_30_3_1,"What a menancing look he had. Anyways, the phantom\nthief Poiclin. I wonder what kind of face she has\nunder the mask?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_30_4_1,"What're you doing!! Hurry up and chase after her!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_40_2_1,"Huh... A phantom thief, an old man sticking to a wall...\nI can't keep up anymore..."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_40_3_1,"Phantom Thief Poiclin seemed like she was worried\nabout something..."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_40_isJoined_2_1,"Ancient weapon...? Something doesn't smell right."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_40_isJoined_3_1,"Phantom Thief Poiclin stole the tablet for Mr. Duston's\nsake. Is she the phantom thief of justice?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_41_2_1,"The old man has a daughter... And he said that they're\nnot blood-related? That's surprisingly nice of him,\nisn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_41_3_1,"Mr. Duston's daughter...!? I never would have imagined\nthat at all...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_50_2_1,"...Ancient weapon or whatever, I don't care, as long\nas it's not my enemy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_50_3_1,"He said junk was more important than his own life...\nI bet it must be hard for Chiri having a father like\nthat."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_1_1,"Looks like this area hasn't been affected by the\ndemonic miasma yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_1_2_1,"...Wow.\nIt's a lively and nice place."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_1_3_1,"This is Mr. Duston's hometown...\nIt somehow makes sense..."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_2_1,"...Oi, oi, are you serious? This old guy's coming\nalong..."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_2_2_1,"This place is as lively as ever... Even if that Junk\nCastle hasn't changed."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_2_3_1,"I wonder if Chiri is here? I hope that she won't have\nto become Poiclin again."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_2_4_1,"Oh, my dear hometown! Hasn't changed a bit at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_2_4_2,"Wanna take a minute at my castle to admire the junk?\nKupupupupu...!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_3_1,"Chiri's father came with us! He's a funny person,\nbut... Is that okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_4_1,"All over the world, wonderful junk is waiting for me!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_15_100_5_1,"This is Mr. Duston's hometown.\nThat building you see over there, or rather\nThe pile of junk, maybe...?"

PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_2_1,"This is Dolworm Kingdom, huh? I was wondering what\nkind of place would be in the desert, but it's a\nnice town, ain't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_3_1,"Wow, amazing... Even the roads and buildings are all\nmade of stone! It's completely different from Eltona."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_4_1,"I don't like it, but every time I look at it, it's amazing!\nThis country's mechanism is amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_4_2,"I don't like it because\nit's just a bunch of useful tricks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_5_1,"It seems that in the royal family of this country, when twins are born, one of them is abandoned in order to prevent\na power struggle between siblings."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_10_5_2,"...Someday, if I have children,\nI would like to raise them so that siblings don't fight with each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_1_1,"The Miasmite...! To think it's capable of that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_2_1,"...Oi, wait a minute, what's with this lady? She just\njoined the party without asking."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_3_1,"Sud... Suddenly, we became her servants... This lady\nis a little scary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_1,"Why! You! You're calling the former Junkie No. 2\nyer servant ta my face!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_2,"Eh? What? I'm sure it's better being Lady Lunana's\nservant than an old man's, like you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_4_3,"MOKI～!!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_20_5_1,"Altering the nature of the Miasmite's power into\nsomething like the Sun Stone is a breakthrough!\nDirector Dura... He is an amazing person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_1_1,"To think they even developed a cloth to bring the\nmiasmites back; amazing tech, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_2_1,"...We're in a volcano, of course it's hot, huh.\nLet's do what we gotta do, so we can get out."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_3_1,"He said that it's dangerous to touch it directly...\nIf I touched it, what do you think would happen...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_1,"Where's the fun in collectin' stones that everybody\nseems ta want?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_2,"You! If you're thinking of cat-burgling the miasmite,\nI won't just let it happen!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_4_3,"Ya're a rude person, aintcha! I wouldn't want\nsomethin' useful like that even if it kills me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_22_5_1,"If we could transmute a miasmite of this size into\na Sun Stone... I think it would gain tremendous power."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_1_1,"That Lunana lady is just like a storm, isn't she...\nLet's all go back to Dolworm too."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_2_1,"...Oi, wait a minute. This time she selfishly slipped\nout on us? What the hell's with that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_3_1,"Those monsters we defeated, to think that just a tiny\nstone like that made them so strong..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_4_1,"Hmph! That person don't understand the value of\nthings, does she! How can ya appreciate such a thing\nlike that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_30_5_1,"It appears that miasmite was sealed by talisman,\ntherefore, does she truly believe it a good idea to\nbring it back...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_1_1,"There's some kind of hidden meaning in that song,\nisn't there. A story from the past, about someone\nbeing born again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_2_1,"...Sad song, huh. How could a parent abandon their\nkid like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_3_1,"No way... I couldn't choose my country over my child\nlike that."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_4_1,"When ya're a baby, all ya do is cute, useless stuff\nlike cry, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_4_2,"Even Chiri was fine at first, but she gradually\nstarted saying things like she wanted to be useful\nto her father...\n<br>\nAnd other unfilial things to say, which was annoying!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_31_5_1,"That song... Once before, I heard from my father\nabout a legend surrounding Dolworm Kingdom; could\nit be..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_1_1,"In the end, she really did bring it back..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_2_1,"...Hmph! If it wasn't for us, she wouldn't have been\nable to bring back such a massive Miasmite!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_3_1,"She should be thanking us for having helped... Is that\ntoo much to ask!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_4_1,"Why does everybody seem to want such an humiliatin'\nexperience of gettin' a Key Emblem."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_32_5_1,"If one could truly transmute a miasmite of that size\ninto a Sun Stone, I believe it would be a great\ninvention capable of saving the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_1_1,"That Miasmite was sealing a monster in it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_2_1,"...Oi, hold on. Looks like we dug up a dangerous guy,\nhuh."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_3_1,"That was Chiri! I wonder if she'll transform into\nPoiclin again and solve the problem in a flash."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_4_1,"Just now, wasn't that Chiri. Come ta think of it, she\nsaid she was workin' in Dolworm Kingdom or somethin'."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_4_2,"It doesn't matter, I completely forgot about it. She's\nstill goin' on about bein' helpful to people and that\nstupid stuff, ain't she."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_40_5_1,"Director Dura was the abandoned twin...? So that song\nwas true after all, was it... How cruel..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_1_1,"We were able to successfully defeat him, but the rift\nbetween the brothers has become even wider, hasn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_2_1,"...We somehow defeated it, but what he left us with\nis bothering me a little. That curse or whatever,\n'despair is still yet to come'..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_3_1,"Prince Ramiza was even thinking about the family of\nthe knights he fights with... He's such a kind person,\nisn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_4_1,"Hmmm. After everythin' was already over, Prince Ramiza\nshowed up too; he's probably got the makings of a\njunkie, don't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_50_5_1,"With that, those two should have harmoniously joined\nhands, however..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_1,"This country has really been saved this time.\nI'm sure they will protect this country for a long time."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_1_1,"I find it hard to believe that Mr. Duston has a daughter\nwho is actually the princess of this country."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_1_5_1,"Choose your country or your child...\nI pray that the day when I have to make such a decision will never come.\nI want to choose a different path!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_1,"...No way, Duston's daughter was the\nabandoned princess after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2,"Well, I don't think Duston cares whether he's royalty or not."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_3,"Of course!\nSuch cheap values ​​\nI don't care!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_1_1,"I was surprised that Mr. Duston's daughter was such\na strong young lady. On the other hand, I guess she's\na teacher..."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2_1,"Chiri ended up not living in the royal palace.\nIsn't it the same as before?\nThings have changed, like Duston is better."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_2_2,"Moky!! Mukyakya!!\nThank you for your help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_3_1,"I'd like to see Poiclin in action again."
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_4_1,"Now, let's go find the next piece of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_4_2,"Mr. Duston...maybe you are trying not to meet\nChiri?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_2_5_1,"With those three people, this country will be safe.\nI have to do my best not to lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_1,"Director Dura, Prince Ramiza\nand Chiri...\nLooks like we'll continue to get along well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_2,"Mr. Duston, are you lonely?"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_3_3,"Hmph! Such an unfilial girl should just go wherever she wants and do whatever she wants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_4_1,"...I didn't see anything!\nI didn't ask!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_4_2,"Chiri is my unfilial daughter!\nAlways has been and always will be!\nThat's it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_16_100_5_1,"Director Dura's hard work was a mistake this time, but\nI feel like I understand her feelings."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_2_1,"...Finally arrived, huh. It's boring riding on that,\nright."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_3_1,"{pc}!\nThe Ark of the Earth is amazing!\nWe reached another continent in no time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_20_4_1,"...Well, I slept well!\nI thought it would be convenient and trivial, but\nThe comfort of sleeping is quite good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_2_1,"...I don't know, but that ride makes me sleepy."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_3_1,"It swayed with a certain rhythm\nIt was so comfortable that I fell asleep!\n{pc}, weren't you sleepy?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_30_4_1,"...Well, I slept well!\nAs always, the comfort of my sleep was great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_2_1,"...Oi, {pc}. You look pale, are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_3_1,"{pc}, are you okay? It looked like you\nwere having a nightmare..."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_40_4_1,"Still a nice, comfy ride, ain't it! If it ever breaks\ndown, I'd like to take care of it."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_2_1,"What's wrong {pc}? You look more serious\nthan usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_3_1,"I thought I would wake up and look at the scenery this\ntime, but I fell asleep again... {pc},\nplease don't laugh, okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_17_50_4_1,"...*Yaaaaawn* Didn't get enough sleep, didja. Is it\nalright if we ride again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_2_1,"...Oi, wait a minute. That geezer was talking big,\nconsidering he failed, wasn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_2_2,"So what're we going to do? Do what the geezer said\nand head for Glen Castletown?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_3_1,"Even Sage Hollow's power wasn't enough...\n{pc}, what should we do?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_20_4_1,"The Heart of Hades... AKA Nergel's castle, ain't it!?\nI gotta hunch that there's probably gonna be some\nincredible junk! Pugi～!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_2_1,"...No matter who you are right now, the one we came\non the adventure with is the {pc}!\nYou!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_3_1,"Even if the inside of you, {pc}, is\nsomeone else, the one who saved me on our adventure\ntogether is the {pc} now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_3_2,"I believe in you, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_30_4_1,"That good-for-nothing character! Eyes that don't show\nany motivation! That's great, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_2_1,"I find it hard to believe you're going 500 years into\nthe past, but listen, {pc}! Make\nsure you come back safely!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_3_1,"{pc}! Be careful when you go, ok.\n...I feel bad that we won't be there to help, you know."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2! Ya couldn't bring me along ta\nthe world of 500 years ago for a lil bit, can ya?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_2,"Mr. Duston, it's no good making junk... Besides,\nsince it's junk, it will surely be thrown away."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_40_4_3,"Hmph! How people don't realize the merits o' junk is\nreally unfortunate, ain't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_90_HIMEA_1,"Nice to meet you, {pc}. If I follow\nyou, I think that boy will get used to his powers."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_99_HIMEA_1,"...Looks like that boy went off by himself. But that's\nno good, is it. Let's hurry after him."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_100_HIMEA_1,"...That boy still doesn't get it. Doing it yourself\nis no good, is it. No good at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_100_HIMEA_2,"{pc}. Let's get the Icebird Feather\nand bring it back to Fostail's place, before that boy."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_110_HIMEA_1,"...That boy, he said let's go together. Hehe. Do you\nthink he's changing a little?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_GARUMII_1,"Oi, Humans and Elf! I won't be fooled, you know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_GARUMII_2,"Oof. It's just a bunch of kids, isn't it. Ms. Garmy.\n...No, Garmy. I look forward to working with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_HIMEA_1,"...There's no way we could convince them to return\nGlen Castle to the Ogres."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_120_HIMEA_2,"...But maybe we can think of something with Erju."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_GARUMII_1,"...Do that for the danged human's salvation, why... Why."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_HIMEA_1,"...Truly, Erju's plan is absurd."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_130_HIMEA_2,"But... That's why it has to be done... This is\nprobably why I'm here now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_GARUMII_1,"He's... Such a tryhard... He really is stupid."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_GARUMII_2,"If he can do that, then I'll make sure to see this\nto the end! And make a painfree future!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_140_HIMEA_1,"...We really made it to Reidametes! If we did that,\nthen we have no choice but to do something, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_141_GARUMII_1,"...The flames vanished. Why is that? Is it okay if we\nget rid of them all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_141_HIMEA_1,"...The flames seem mysterious for some reason, right.\nI wonder if there are others?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_GARUMII_1,"...Dang it! Next time, we'll definitely win!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_GARUMII_2,"That human... I'd like to see where Erju's going next!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_145_HIMEA_1,"For the sake of our future, we will never lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_2_1,"...It looks like you returned safely. Well, I was\nwondering if you were successful."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_3_1,"Welcome home, {pc}! ...Eh? You met\nLady Himea? ...Eeh? And Lady Yakuru too!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_3_2,"I don't know anything about Lady Yakura, except the\nfew things I was taught at school, but to think you\nmet such an amazing person, you know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_170_4_1,"So... So... What kind of junk was there 500 years ago?!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_2_1,"...This time we should be good to go to the\nNetherlord's place, right. I'm itchin' to put my skills\nto use!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_3_1,"{pc}, let's do our best, okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_180_4_1,"Finally, we'll get ta see what junk that Netherlord\nor whatever's got, ain't we! I'm sure it's some\nunbelievable junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_1_1,"That was the Netherlord Nergel's voice, right? He'll\nsee, we'll definitely defeat him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_2_1,"Heh. Polite of him to give us a warm welcome, huh?\nProtect ya neck, Nergel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_3_1,"Fifi worked hard, so we have to do our best too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_4_1,"This is the Hades' Heart, ain't it? With his evil\ntaste, I bet that we'll find some unbelievable junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_183_5_1,"Mother, Father... Please watch over us. Soon, it\nwill all be over!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_1_1,"...Nergel! Next time, we won't lose!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_2_1,"Damn...! Next time, we're not gonna lose!\n{pc}, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_3_1,"In the old days, I absolutely would have\ngave up, but I'm different now. {pc},\nlet's do our best again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_4_1,"...Hmph!\nI never give up on the junk I'm aiming for!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_4_2,"I'll definitely turn that Hades' heart into junk and bring it home!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_188_5_1,"I can still fight!\nI can't leave Hades alone!\n{pc}, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_1_1,"Arold...\nMy journey was worth it."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_2_1,"Ah.......\nIt's over, really."
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_3_1,"Hey, {pc}.\nThis isn't a dream, right?\nWe really did it, right!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_4_1,"Castle junk!\nWe'll see you again soon!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_195_5_1,"Mom, Dad...\nHave I become closer to the king like my father?　"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_1_1,"If you are going to Lendersia,\nyou must train.\n{pc}, thank you for your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_2_1,"Next time you're going to Lendersia, right?\nI can't even imagine what it's like, but\nI need to train hard.　"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_3_1,"{pc}\nNext, you're going to Lendersia, right?\nOf course I'm going too, so let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_4_1,"Next, I'm going to collect\nthe junk I haven't seen yet in Lendersia!! Kupupupupup!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_18_200_5_1,"This trip made me realize how immature I am.\nUntil the day I can proudly return to my country\nThank you very much, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_2_1,"Lendersia, huh... There's gotta be strong guys out\nthere, right? I'm itchin' to put my skills to use!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_3_1,"{pc}, Lendersia is your birthplace...\nIsn't that right? Do you miss it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_4_1,"When the heck are we goin' ta Lendersia? Junk's\nwaitin' fer me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_5_1,"Sage Hollow said that eventually we would be able to\ngo to Lendersia, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_5_2,"By ship... In Port Town Lendor, do you believe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_1_1,"Many people will be in trouble if the ship doesn't\nleave port, y'know. Let's all help gather the materials\ntoo."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_2_1,"If the compass doesn't get fixed, we won't even be\nable to go to Lendersia. What a pain..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_3_1,"We can get the Infinite Magnetite from two kinds of\nmonsters, eh. {pc}, which one would\nyou choose?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_4_1,"I don't know if we're lookin' fer magnetic stones\nor Hell; having to find such a useful thing is\nhumiliatin'!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_5_1,"This is the restored route to Lendersia that Sage\nHollow had mentioned..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_10_5_2,"Let us quickly gather the materials and go to that\nplace."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_1_1,"Infinite Magnetite... An amazing name, but it doesn't\nlook much different from a normal stone, does it."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_2_1,"A little pebble like that can move a compass, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_3_1,"We should deliver this stone and the 5 Magic Waters\nto the Travel Concierge at an inn, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_4_1,"Let's hurry up and deliver that stone or whatever we\nfound! We don't need somethin' that's useful for\npeople!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_15_5_1,"I see. It appears that this Infinite Magnetite allows\none to use their compass, even in the Mystifying Mist."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_1_1,"What we got is not the Boarding Pass, eh. It's a\nvoucher that can be exchanged for one..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_1,"A monster that just dropped a pebble isn't even a\nwarm-up. Isn't there a stronger one?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_2,"When we get to Lendersia, we may have to fight even\nstronger enemies, y'know. Isn't it better to save up\nyour stamina?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_2_3,"...I gotcha."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_3_1,"If we take the Boarding Pass Voucher with us, we can\nexchange it for the ship's Boarding Pass to Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_4_1,"There ain't a junk voucher, is there?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_5_1,"The Ship Bureau of South Port Town Lendor is the\nonly place one can receive Boarding Passes..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_343_200_5_2,"I see. Only those people trusted with the construction\nof the ship may board it."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsNotOgre_4_1,"I wonder what kind of person this 'Awakened Hero\nPrincess' is?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsNotOgre_4_2,"After all, considering she's a hero, she should be\nstrong, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsOgre_4_1,"The light that saved Giganf was Proof of the Awakening."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_10_IsOgre_4_2,"The hero who emitted that light is across the sea."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_1_1,"Finally, we're ready to set sail. I'm so excited to\nget on a big ship."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_1_2,"Someday, I hope to sail on one together with Arold too."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_1,"Alright. Let's hurry up and board the Grand Titus."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_2,"We have to save the world quick so the brats can live\npeacefully."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_2_3,"...Hyuza is very caring, in his own way."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_3_1,"Finally, Lendersia... I wonder what it's like?"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_1,"Lendersia... Unknown lands! A country I ain't never\nseen before!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_2,"What kinds o' worthless things it has! The rubbish!\nThe junk! I'm looking forward to it, y'know!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_4_3,"I'm not shocked, y'know, Mr. Duston... When I heard\nfrom everyone about the time with your daughter, Chiri,\nI had to double take."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_1,"If we go to Lendersia, Uncle will have to take care of\naffairs for longer still, won't he..."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_2,"However, this is a journey of my own choosing! What\nI have to do is not finished yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_3,"And I won't have that. To prove myself worthy of\nbecoming King of Megistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_19_20_5_4,"...Father, Mother, I am certain that is what you would\nexpect of me too."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_1_1,"Before the ship shoved off, that person who bought the\nBoarding Pass... They paid in advance, but got scolded\nover a misunderstanding, I feel sorry for them, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_1_2,"But something seemed a little strange..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_2_1,"That man with the hat... I felt like the guy who was\nselling the boarding pass was trying to pick a fight\nwith him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_2_2,"He's a shady guy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_3_1,"Something this big floats on water... Amazing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_4_1,"Being surrounded by all these high-quality lookin'\nthings and not being able to escape since we're on\nthe ocean! I feel awful!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_5_1,"To think that even such a finely crafted ship cannot\nreach Lendersia without the Magic Compass..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_10_5_2,"Are the people of Lendersia safe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_1_1,"That man called himself Crows, right. Who is he...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_1_2,"For now, let's go after that red-haired sailor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_2_1,"I don't like following that Crows guy's orders, but\nfor now, let's chase that sailor who left."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_3_1,"He does lots of suspicious things, but... Still, he\nseems dependable..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_3_2,"That Crows person makes me feel a little confused!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_4_1,"That man called Crows turnin' someone else's memory\ninto junk, an incredible power, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_4_2,"Former Junkie No. 2. If yours turns to junk, I'll\nmake you my assistant again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_5_1,"Somehow I feel as though that person called Crows is\nmanipulating us."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_20_5_2,"And yet, should we try to go to the first deck as he\ninstructed? If my intuition is correct..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_1_1,"The Netherlord Nergel had ordered his underlings to\nget in the way of people heading towards Lendersia..."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_1_2,"Anyways, Mr. Crows... He defeated that monster in a\nsingle blow after all, we'll have to be be cautious\nof that."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_2_1,"Oi, wait a minute, had he jumped into the sea like\nthat, would he have had us all look for them?"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_2_2,"Whatever, with this, we'll be able to reach Lendersia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_3_1,"Mr. Crows was just as amazing a person as we thought."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_3_2,"I hope nothing else happens until we get to Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_1,"Already going to sleep? If we got free time like\nthat, I wanna look for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_2,"If you want to look for junk, old man, do it yourself."
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_4_3,"Daaamn. You lot don't get the merits of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_20_30_5_1,"Just what kind of person do you think Mr. Crows is?\nHe appears an awfully, elusive person, does he not."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_1_1,"It was short, but fun being on a ship. But still,\ntraveling on our own feet is more suitable for me."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_1,"For whatever reason, it looks like we arrived at a\ndifferent spot than our destination, but for now, we\nmade it to Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_2,"Ha! Don't worry. From the start, I never thought we'd\nbe able to go without any trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_2_3,"Riiight. It's a journey to save the world after all.\nTrouble's an unavoidable part of that."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_3_1,"This is Lendersia, isn't it. But why is this? I can't\nhear the wind's voice..."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_3_2,"I don't get what that 'wind's voice' thing is that\nyou said, but there's definitely something strange\ngoing on."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_4_1,"Even with somethin' like that Magic Compass, we\ncouldn't properly arrive at our destination... That's\na good omen, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_4_2,"Come on! Lendersia's junk is waiting for us!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_5_1,"Mr. Crows left earlier, but I feel as though we shall\nsee him again soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_10_5_2,"N-no... I am unable to foresee for some reason."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_1_1,"We have to go to Gran Zedora as soon as possible to\nmeet the Hero Princess..."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_1_2,"I don't accept what Crows says too much, but there's\nno other choice, so it can't be helped, can it."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_2_1,"3 Butterflies? What do butterflies have to do with\ngoing to Gran Zedora?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_2_2,"Butterflies... I don't know much about that, although\nhe helped out on the Grand Titus too, so it has to\nhave some meaning, doesn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_3_1,"Mr. Crows knows a lot, doesn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_3_2,"...But why would he tell us that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_4_1,"Behind that door is some lovely junk waiting for me,\nI'm sure of it!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_4_2,"I'll definitely go through that gate with the\n3 butterflies!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_5_1,"Mr. Crows... As I expected, our paths crossed again."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_5_2,"Nevertheless, butterflies... Could they somehow be a\nmetaphor?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_1_1,"Even if we collect the butterflies, I have no idea how we\ncan open the gate with this...."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_1_2,"There's no point in thinking about it.\nI guess we have no choice but to do as Mr. Crows told us\nand collect the 3 Butterflies."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_2_1,"Is the butterfly that Crows was talking about\nthe one you received earlier?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_2_2,"But it's a butterfly...\nIt doesn't even look like a key, so how can I go to\nGran Zedora with this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_3_1,"Butterflies...\nAs Mr. Crows said,\nit really happened."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_3_2,"It wasn't a real butterfly, but...\nShould I just collect three like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_4_1,"Why are you forcing\nsomething of value on me!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_4_2,"I'll endure it to pass the Three Way Gate, but\nI'd be happier if I received\nsome useless junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_5_1,"...As expected, it wasn't about a real butterfly."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_20_Clear1over_5_2,"How did\nMr. Crows know that this was available in the first place?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_1_1,"Finally, we gathered the 3 Butterflies. We went\nthrough so much getting them, that I'm attached to\nthem all."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_2_1,"Now that all 3 Butterflies are together, the gate will\nfinally open. Been a nice, long journey so far, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_3_1,"{pc}, we these, we can pass through\nThree Way Gate!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_4_1,"Since we got the 3 Butterflies, we can wave goodbye\nta the humiliatin' days bein' helpful 'n appreciated!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_4_2,"Pass Three Way Gate, lots of little junk is waitin'\nfor us!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_5_1,"We gathered the 3 Butterflies that Mr. Crows spoke of."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_30_5_2,"However, what in the world does that person intend to\ndo with those butterflies?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_1_1,"...I guess we have no choice but to go another way to\nGran Zedora?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_2_1,"...What's that about? That Crows guy tricked us, huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_3_1,"Eehhh!? Even though we collected the 3 Butterflies,\nthey won't let us pass?"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_3_2,"Mr. Crows didn't seem like one who would lie, buuut."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_4_1,"The butterflies we worked so hard collectin' are good\nfor nothin'..."
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_4_2,"That Crows guy's down to earth, ain't he!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_21_35_5_1,"We can't force ourselves through the gate, so I\nsuppose we have no choice but to turn back."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_1_1,"He said something about us being the monsters'\nunderlings, didn't he. This village must have some\nkind of problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_1_2,"I just wish there was something we could do for the\nvillage children who stood up for us earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_2_1,"...Monsters showed up in the village, huh. That\nbrother and sister from earlier seem to be wandering\naround here without any problem, but are they safe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_1,"That came out of nowhere so suddenly! Do we look\nthat suspicious?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_2,"Well, there's one suspicious guy here."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_3_3,"Don't praise me like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_4_1,"This is a bit o' a run-down village, ain't it! I'm\nlookin' forward to this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_15_5_1,"He was quite weary of us, was he not. Has something\nhas occurred?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_1_1,"Is that boy, Raska, okay? I'm worried, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_2_1,"The village hero took down the ghosts at the same\ntime... Huh. I was hoping for a contest with him,\nbut..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_2_2,"Now that he's gone, everyone is in trouble. Let's do\nas much as we can about helping them out."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_3_1,"Ghosts!... They mean monsters, right?... There's no\nsuch thing as ghosts, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_4_1,"Ghosts wit' just parts o' their bodies? Hmm, that's\nvery interestin', ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_5_1,"........."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_20_5_2,"Pardon me... When I was looking at Raska and Chief\nGash, I was reminded of my father."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_1_1,"Mishua, was it. It seems like the village is in\ntrouble; are you okay going with us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_1_2,"It's okay. I'm worried about grandma too. I'm sure\nRaska will be happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_1,"Say, you know what's up with the ghosts?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_2,"I saw them firsthand, but no..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_2_3,"It's just parts of a dismembered body, like the head\nand legs... It feels different from monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_3_1,"Why does Ms. Kope live away from everyone in Melsandy\nVillage?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_3_2,"Grandma is the caretaker of the waterwheel, and-how\nshould I put it-she's a bit difficult... Although,\nshe's actually a very kind person."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_4_1,"Hmph! I hate waterwheels and stuff that's useful to\neveryone!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_5_1,"Raska... I hope you will reconcile with Chief Gash."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_19_1,"Thanks to the words I borrowed from Hero Zankrone,\nRaska seems to understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_23_19_2,"Although I hope he'll make up with Uncle Gash and go\nback to his usual, energetic self."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_1_1,"Let's hurry up and fix the gears in the waterwheel\nso we can take Ms. Kope back to the village chief's\nplace."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_2_1,"She's such a shrewd old lady, huh. I never thought\nwe'd go to pick her up and she'd force chores on us."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_3_1,"Ms. Kope... She said it was for the money she hid\naway, but it's definitely about Raska, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_4_1,"Fixin' a worn-out waterwheel, I don't like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_4_2,"But outside that, I'm a liiittle curious 'bout the\ninside of the waterwheel, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_1,"'Time is gold'!... Those are words to ponder on."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_2,"Huh? Do you even want money?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_3,"Not quite. I mean time is as important as money, but\nlost time is something that money cannot buy.\n...I believe."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_5_4,"That's right. We also don't wanna waste our time in\na place like this, so we can save the world right\naway."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_19_1,"Heheh. Grandma Kope adores Raska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_30_19_2,"While Grandma is getting ready, let's go check out\nthe waterwheel."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_1,"That Man O' War... Did it give us that gem as thanks?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_2,"But Ms. Kope took the gem away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_1_3,"Looks like it'll be hard to get Kope to give it back\nto us. I'm sorry for that Man O' War, but let's give\nup on it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_2_1,"Snatching things she wants from people, she's a\ngreedy granny, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_3_1,"I wonder how much it that big gem would've sold for..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_4_1,"Even though we dug up the stream, I ain't find any\njunk at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_5_1,"It appears that Ms. Kope, truly wishes to see Raska\ndoes it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_19_1,"Thanks to you, {pc} and everybody,\nwe should be able to bring Grandma Kope back to the\nvillage as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_50_19_2,"I want to get Grandma Kope to Raska and Uncle Gash\nright away."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_1_1,"Melsandy Village Inn's VIP room... I wonder what it's\nlike?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_2_1,"That old lady's trouble, huh. But I'm looking forward\nto that VIP room. Hurry, let's go to the inn."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_1,"Ms. Kope seemed happy to see Raska, didn't she."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_2,"Right. Anyways, I never thought that she'd give the\ngem back. I guess she was really happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_3,"Although, the gem was originally for {pc},\nwas it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_3_4,"If I got something valuable like that gem, I wouldn't\nbe happy at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_1,"'Viproom' is a kinda junkie-sounding name, ain't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_2,"'VIP Room' means it is a room for very important\npeople. It appears that they are very grateful."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_4_3,"Hey! 'Very important people'! Please stop treatin'\nme so badly!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_5_1,"I am relieved that Ms. Kope was able to safely see\nthe village chief and Raska."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_53_5_2,"However, where in the world is the butterfly that\nMr. Crows was mentioning?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_1_1,"The monster that just left the village... It's the\none the village chief was talking about, right? If\nsomeone has been kidnapped, we need to help fast!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_2_1,"We have to go rescue the kidnapped person. Let's head\nwest of the village, to the square!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_3_1,"Even though it's only hands, it's a big enough\nmonster to drag people away!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_3_2,"I'm sca... Scared, but, {pc}, as long\nas I'm with you and everybody, I'll be fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_4_1,"A huge hand monster, huh... Ain't there a more junkie\nlookin' monster than that, like an earlobe monster\nor somethin'?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_60_5_1,"It's terrible...! We must make haste west of the\nvillage for Sunbeam Square!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_1_1,"Raska, it's reckless going it alone! Hurry, let's go\nafter him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_2_1,"That Raska kid, even though he's a brat, he shouldn't\nbe so reckless...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_2_2,"But I gotta recognize that heart of his!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_3_1,"{pc}, let's go save Mishua! We can't\njust leave Raska alone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_4_1,"The monster lives inside a well... I feel like that\nthing's got a junkie style!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_5_1,"Let us chase after the hand ghost as well!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_70_5_2,"Unable to save his own children, that look of\nfrustration on Chief Gash's face... We cannot forsake\nthem!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_1_1,"That Hero Zankrone is tiny, but super strong, isn't\nhe."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_1_2,"I think I get why Raska looks up to him."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_2_1,"Hero Zankrone was still alive, huh. If Raska's story\nwas true, I didn't think he would die so easily."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_3_1,"The person who was kidnapped before was also safe!\nI'm glad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_3_2,"Looks like Mishua went home first, so I already\nrelieved!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_4_1,"I can't believe there wasn't even a single piece of\njunk. Why did that monster bother being hand-shaped?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_1,"We have reached a point of relief, but... What in\nthe world do you think that hand monster was..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_2,"It did not feel as though... It was a mere monster."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_80_5_3,"And how did the village hero, Zankrone, get so small...\nThis is full of mysteries, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_1_1,"I wonder where the Mishua we met went to? To think\nthere's 2 Mishuas..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_1_2,"Something about this just doesn't make sense, does it."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_1,"Mishua, but... She's a totally different person,\nright. Who is that Mishua..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_2,"Oi, Raguas! You know what I'm talking about, right?\nWhy has Mishua completely changed?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_2_3,"...No, I haven't the slightest clue either."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_3_1,"I thought Zankrone said he'd return to the village\ntoo, but he wasn't here."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_3_2,"Did he go somewhere to get rid of the monsters again?"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_4_1,"How did nobody notice that that Mishua girl has been\nreplaced... I'm starting to like this village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_5_1,"I do not understand about Mishua either, however..."
PT_TALK_TXT_22_100_5_2,"Do you believe? That this hairpin is a butterfly\nthat Mr. Crows had mentioned..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_1_1,"The town of only children, Celed...? Are there really\nno adults? Don't you think that's dangerous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_1_2,"Since nobody will even try to give us the details,\nlet's go to the church on the hill."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_2_1,"She was a cocky brat, huh... For now, let's go check\nout that church on the hill."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_3_1,"The town of only kids' Queen... She might be kinda\ncool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_4_1,"A town of just kids... Looks like it's got some nice\njunk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_5_1,"Where in the world do you believe the adults of Celed\ncould have gone to?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_11_5_2,"The girl who called herself the Queen had a monster\nas her butler, so there are many things we do not\nunderstand."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_1_1,"If it's a Hacksaurus, I noticed some near the town.\nLet's go check it out."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_2_1,"Bring a Dragon's Tail, huh. Is this what that cocky\nQueen was talking about to judge us as honorary kids?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_3_1,"That cool Queen won't judge us without it. I thought\nthat we'd be able to talk; how disappointing."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_4_1,"I don't wanna pass the judgement or do anything like\nthat to be recognized by others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_20_5_1,"We can obtain the Dragon Tail by defeating Hacksauri\nat Celedot Mountain Pass, can we."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_1_1,"We should take this Dragon's Tail to the gatekeeper\nkid, right. The Queen should be waiting for us too."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_2_1,"We got the Dragon's Tail, huh. Let's hurry to High\nChurch in Celed."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_3_1,"We did it! Hurry, let's take it to the church on the\nhill in Celed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_3_2,"With that, we'll pass the judgement, right. Passed\nthe judgement... That has a great ring to it, doesn't\nit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_4_1,"They want stuff like dragon's horns, fangs, n' tails;\nthere's a bit o' hope fer them yet, ain't there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_5_1,"For us, it was without issue, however for an ordinary\nadult, obtaining a Dragon's Tail would quite serious,\nwould it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_30_5_2,"Why do you believe they would go to such lengths to\nnot want adults around?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_1_1,"The girl who called herself the Queen seems hard to\nplease, but I'm worried if she really recognizes\nwhat's going on in town."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_2_1,"Now that we brought the Dragon's Tail, the Queen has to talk to us, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_2_2,"This game of hers makes you wanna yell."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_3_1,"But we passed the High Church test, didn't we? I'm a\nlit... A little nervous."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_4_1,"Now that we've passed the test, we don't even get to\ntake the junk in the church; it ain't worth it, was\nit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_33_5_1,"Well... With that, at least we can begin to understand\nthe situation in Celed, even if only a little bit."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_1,"There really are only children here, isn't there.\nI get why that Liselotte girl brings everyone\ntogether."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_2,"But honorary kids don't get snacks, I feel bad for\nFuura and Prince Raguas, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_1_3,"I am quite fine without snacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_2_1,"Even those brats too... They seem to be having fun,\nbut are they really safe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_3_1,"Honorary children don't get snacks, huh... Uh-umm!\nIt's nothing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_4_1,"Honorary child? I don't want things like honor! I'm\nsatisfied bein' a dishonorable adult!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_40_5_1,"She may be a child, but I believe she has a splendid\nway of ruling this town, however... Do you believe\nthat they are safe with such rules?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_1_1,"He invited them to pray for the adult's return, but...\nEverybody totally ignored him, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_1_2,"I wonder if not everybody wants the adults to come\nback?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_2_1,"The brats are eating nothing but snacks, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_2_2,"Eating only what one likes is bad for one's health."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_1,"......"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_2,"...What is it? In a bad mood because you couldn't\neat snacks?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_3,"N-No! It's just... He said something about bringing\nthe adults back, that'd really be nice, wouldn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_3_4,"...I getcha. There are kids who want adults to care\nfor them, and kids who think they're annoying."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_4_1,"That familiar, Muccino, he's able to make junk too,\nain't he? I'm interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_1,"With a familiar that can summon whatever one wishes\nwhenever, I understand why she would be called the\nQueen."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_2,"But how long can they continue to live like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_50_5_3,"I am also curious about the plan they had mentioned\nearlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_1_1,"...There's no way that Liselotte girl... I hope\nthat's not what she's doing."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_1_2,"She must be desperately working hard to take the\nplace of the adults."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_2_1,"She said she was relieved that adults weren't around.\n...Good thing Somya wasn't here to hear that, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_3_1,"I don't like being lectured, but I like it even less\nwhen adults disappear."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_3_2,"{pc}, Maiyu, Hyuza... Even Mr. Duston\ntoo--although he's a little odd--but there's lots of\ngood adults after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_4_1,"Screwin' up the ritual and totally erasin' the adults\nis pretty junkie, ain't it! Promisin' signs!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_5_1,"Where do you believe all the adults in town could\nhave disappeared to?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_60_5_2,"She had mentioned that it was due to the failure in\nsummoning that caused their disappearance, however is\nit so convenient that only the adults disappeared?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_1_1,"As adults, it's our responsibility to stop Liselotte\nand the others from trying to do something dangerous,\ny'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_1_2,"I don't think I can stop Liz by myself. Please, I'm\nbegging you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_2_1,"Even though Firo is desperately trying to stop her,\nthat Queen... Has the nerve to ignore him."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_2_2,"I don't like it when someone pushes away somebody\nwho's worried about them."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_3_1,"It's okay, Firo. We'll figure something out! Right,\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_3_2,"Th-thank you so much!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_4_1,"The tower you're told never, ever approach... There's\ndefinitely some junk there, ain't there! Gupupupupu!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_1,"We have to stop Liselotte. However, for the sake of\nthe children of Celed, what is the right thing to do?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_2,"The first thing is stop the genie summoning ritual.\nIf something happens, then it'll be too late, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_5_3,"I'm ashamed to admit it, but I don't think I can\nstop Liz by myself... I'm begging you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_16_1,"Liz didn't listen to me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_70_16_2,"Even so, to protect everyone, I have to stop Liz!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_1_1,"Liselotte really intends to begin the ritual. We\ndon't know what dangers there may be."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_1_2,"We have to somehow stop the genie summoning ritual!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_2_1,"A kingdom of only children without adults... At their\nage, one might would think it's like a dreamland, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_3_1,"The Queen got an Amber Jewel with a butterfly in it...\nCould it be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_3_2,"Ah! For now, it's more important that we stop the\ngenie summoning ritual. Hurry, let's return to Celed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_4_1,"I was expectin' ta find junk in the tower, but there\nwas nothin' 'cept a shiny orb, Agyagyagya! How\ndepressin'!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_4_2,"When we get back ta Celed, I'll ask that familiar ta\nmake mountains o' junk ta take my mind off it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_1,"A dreamland where one can live and play as much as\none wishes... If such a country could truly be\ncreated, do you believe that would be a good thing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_2,"However, it is too convenient that there exists a\ngenie whom will grant any of one's wishes for me to\nbelieve such a thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_5_3,"Yes... I'm sure there must be a reason why the adults\ntold us to never go near Rinja Tower."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_1,"Everyone calls her the Queen, but Liz is just an\nordinary kid like the rest of us."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_2,"Any yet, since everyone relies on Liz, she may also\nfeel responsible and overdo it trying to do something."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_80_16_3,"Let's go after Liz! Before something dangerous\nhappens..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_1_1,"We won't let the children of Celed become servants\nof that Genie!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_1_2,"{pc}! Hurry, let's get back to\nHigh Church!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_2_1,"We can't keep Liselotte's waiting on her wish to\nsee her parents, can we..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_2_2,"He said he'll make those brats his servants...\nI don't want those dumbasses trying to create such\na stupid country!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_3_1,"I won't forgive them for deceiving the Queen and the\nothers for all this time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_3_2,"We won't lose again to that Genie who laughs at\nothers' pain!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_1,"Ta think that familiar was foolin' us... Considering\nher seemingly able attitude, I didn't expect her ta\nbe the Queen of Junk, ain't she!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_2,"Instead of bein' that Genie's servant, I want her as\nmy assistant!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_4_3,"Assistant... Anyways, let's save the Queen and the\nothers!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_5_1,"It is wrong to trick children, in order to build a\nkingdom for one's own desires! I will never overlook\nthat!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_1,"Liz really fooled us after all, didn't she... But I\ncan't do anything with that Genie and his partner on\nmy own."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_2,"I'm begging you! Please lend me your power again!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_3,"Hey, enough said! I feel bad about losing like that.\nTogether, we'll take them on head-first!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_4,"Yeah! Let's all do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_83_16_5,"Everyone...! Thank you so much!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_1_1,"We couldn't grant the kids' wishes, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_1_2,"As adults, we have to watch over the kids."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_2_1,"It sucks those shady monsters fooled them like that...\nThat's why we can't live in a kid kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_2_2,"...It's hard when you don't have adults to rely on\nwhen you need them."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_3_1,"Everyone. Let's go to Alltrades Abbey!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_3_2,"I want to see what Firo and the others are doing."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_4_1,"I ain't interested in temples! Everything's all\nshiny and polished; it's just not my taste!"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_5_1,"In the end, the children of Celed were deceived,\nweren't they."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_90_5_2,"Then, do you believe that the adults' disappearance\ndue to the failure of the summoning ritual was a lie\nthat they were told...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_1_1,"I wonder if everyone's thoughts and prayers didn't\nreach them... It's almost too much to bear, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_2_1,"I thought that, maybe, if it was at Alltrades Abbey..."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_2_2,"Did the Goddess forget her own job?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_3_1,"'One day, I'll make this town a lovely place, where\neven honorary children are allowed to eat snacks.'"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_3_2,"Those guys had more guts than we expected, huh.\nThey'll be okay... I'm sure of it."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_4_1,"Not doing somethin' like grantin' those kids' wishes\nis pretty junkie of the Goddess, ain't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_5_1,"The adults in town have not returned, have they...\nThe positive attitude of the children is at least\nsome consolation."
PT_TALK_TXT_23_100_5_2,"In addition to the Amber Jewel that Liselotte\nbestowed upon us... Inside is a butterfly, after all,\ncould it be the one Mr. Crows had mentioned...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_1_1,"Even if you don't know anything about who you were...\nAs long as you don't betray the heart you have now,\nyou'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_2_1,"Even if you totally forget your name or past, as\nlong as you have the will to move forward, that's\nenough, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_3_1,"He said that somehow everyone in the kingdom lost\ntheir memories, didn't he. And they even forgot\ntheir names too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_3_2,"I... {pc}, before I went on this\njourney with you, I wasn't very likable, but I don't\nwant to forget that about myself..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_4_1,"All the people, can't even remember their names; what\na nice, junkie kingdom, ain't it! I like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_20_5_1,"All the citizens have lost their memories...? I could\nnot even imagine how exhausting it must be to lead\npeople in such a state..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_1,"Even if they don't like it, we wouldn't let them gang\nup on a girl, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_2,"Really, thank you so much for earlier! I can't forgive\nthem for such a cowardly thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_1_3,"I get what you mean, but being reckless won't help."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_2_1,"Seraphy, you hanging in there? I understand how you\nfeel, but you're too reckless."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_2_2,"But I felt bad for them and couldn't bear to watch.\nThank you for helping me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_1,"I thought the King of Arahaghiro was a good person who\ncared a lot about the people of his kingdom, but."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_2,"Even monsters like the one in Sui's Tower will\nunderstand if you talk to them..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_3,"Is that so!? Then, it wouldn't be strange if there\nwere other monsters that could get along with people,\nwould it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_4,"Yeah...! The atmosphere in the fighting arena was\nscary, but I'm glad we met you, Seraphy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_3_5,"Ehehe. Me too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_1,"I think it's more fun ta show each other junk than\nta make monsters fight, ain't it"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_2,"Ahah! That sounds fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_4_3,"You're an awfully reasonable girl, ain'tcha. I like\nit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_1,"It may be a monster, however, it does not feel right\nto make its execution a spectacle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_2,"Although it is for the sake of the people who have\nlost their memories, is there not a better way?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_5_3,"There may be a clue at Murudo Moutain. So come with\nme! Please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_1,"Doing a cruel thing like turning one's sword on an\ninjured, harmless monster; I'll never forgive the\nKing and his companions."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_2,"Still I never thought that people could make me so\nangry... {pc}, thank you for helping me."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_30_17_3,"Since you're such kind people, I want to show you\nsomething at Murudo Mountain."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_1_1,"A Monster Master made this gravestone for its\nmonster... They must've loved the monsters here,\ndidn't they."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_2_1,"A monster champion, huh... I bet it was really\nstrong, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_2_2,"...I wonder what the King was thinking, coming to a\nplace like this by himself."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_3_1,"Hmm... There were a lots of Monster Masters who\ngrieved in this country, weren't there."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_3_2,"I wonder if, since they lost their memory, they\ntotally forget that too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_4_1,"...What is it? Don't expect me ta do somethin' useful\nlike reading the words on the tombstone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_1,"Hmm... Monster battling in itself in Arahaghiro Kingdom\nmay be a traditional custom, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_2,"I do not believe the show we witnessed earlier felt\nas though it were an equal confrontation in a kingdom\nof Monster Masters, did it."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_5_3,"Something isn't adding up, is it. I wonder, does\nlosing one's memory really mean that they totally\nforgot everything?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_17_1,"Looks like the monsters sleeping in Murudo Moutain's\ngraves were good friends with the Monster Masters,\ndoesn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_35_17_2,"<pc>! There's a big stone monument back\nhere I want you to see! Hurry, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_1_1,"A Great Sabrecat with a cross-shaped scar on its left\neye. If it has such a noticeable feature like that,\nit should stick out right away, shouldn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_2_1,"That Seraphy girl was a Monster Master... Before\nshe lost her memory, was she really able to control\nmonsters...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_1,"Seraphy was wearing the same bracelet as the Great\nSabrecat... I bet you were friends, weren't you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_2,"And I feel like if I see it again I should be able\nto remember. So could you help me find it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_3_3,"Of course. Right, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_4_1,"...Helpin' someone again. I only came wit' ya ta find\njunk, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_5_1,"""One cannot be a true Monster Master without a heart\nthat accepts even the most vicious of monsters""..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_5_2,"Having an accepting heart benefits not only Monster\nMasters, but person-to-person relationships as well,\ndoes it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_17_1,"If I really was that Great Sabrecat's Monster Master,\nthen I can't leave it alone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_40_17_2,"Let's go to Jyra Jungle! Since it has cross-shaped\nscar on its left eye, we'll know if we've found it\nright away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_1_1,"The Great Sabrecat with a cross-shaped scar on his\neye that we're looking for may be deep in the jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_1_2,"We don't know what other monsters are out there, so\nlet's be careful."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_2_1,"...Looking for a single monster in the jungle, huh?\nLooks like it's going to be difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_1,"You said the monsters in Jyra Jungle are really\nstrong, didn't you? I'm a little scared..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_2,"But, but! To get back Seraphy's memory, I'll give my\nall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_3_3,"Thank you, Fuura! I'll do my best too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_1,"Kupupupupu...! Ancient ruins hidden in the jungle!\nI gotta feelin' there's gonna be some lovely junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_2,"...You know we're here for the Great Sabrecat with a\ncross-shaped scar on its left eye, right? If you take\na detour, we'll leave you behind."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_4_3,"Abandonin' someone like that is pretty junkie...\nYou're not bad, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_1,"Tracking down a single monster inside the jungle...\nAlthough it has a cross-shaped scar, it appears this\nshall be difficult, will it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_2,"However, if Seraphy's memory is restored, it may\nprovide a hint towards regaining the memories of the\nother Arahaghiro Kingdom citizens."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_5_3,"Ugh. It might be a bit of a big responsibility...\nBut I'll remember the best I can, okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_17_1,"Great Sabrecats are very sneaky. So I'm sure it's\nhiding somewhere deep in the jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_45_17_2,"I was nervous about exploring the jungle by myself,\nso having everyone here is reassuring!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_1_1,"I'm glad she was able to meet her partner safely...\nI was very worried that time Arold was kidnapped too."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_2_1,"He's an impressive Great Sabrecat, huh. He looks\nstrong!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_3_1,"When he was called Clawde, he seemed a little unhappy,\nbut... He's okay, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_3_2,"Still, I'm glad we found him safely!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_4_1,"That Great Sabrecat, Clawde, seems more well-behaved\nthan Junkie No. 1; I don't like it."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_1,"""One cannot be a true Monster Master without a heart\nthat accepts even the most vicious of monsters""..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_2,"As was written on the stone monument at Murudo\nMountain, Seraphy--as a true Monster Master--formed\na bond with Clawde."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_5_3,"I hope that Seraphy's experience will be conveyed to\nKing Bermud and the others."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_1,"I want everyone in Arahaghiro to understand that not\nall monsters are our enemies."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_2,"To do that, first, we have to go back to Arahaghiro\nand let them know about Monster Masters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_50_17_3,"Clawde and I will prove to everyone that people and\nmonsters form a bond!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_1_1,"Making Monster Partners fight each other until there's\nonly one left is a cruel thought, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_1_2,"We have to stop that stupid event no matter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_2_1,"Before the monsters hurt each other and die, let's\nrush over to the Monster's Service Entrance east of\nArahaghiro!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_3_1,"Even if they're monsters, making them fight to the\ndeath is heartless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_3_2,"It may be hard to convince them that even people and\nmonsters can be friends, but we have to!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_4_1,"Places ya can't normally go ta oughta have good junk;\nit's decided! Let's go to the Monster Arena's Service\nEntrance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_1,"Why would one who has come to the monsters' graveyard\nlike King Bermud, do such a heartless thing...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_2,"Does it have to do with people losing their memories?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_5_3,"I don't know, but... Anyway, we must save the\nmonsters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_1,"Survival deathmatch... The lives of monsters aren't\ntools to entertain people..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_2,"I don't want monsters to suffer because of such an\ncruel event!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_60_17_3,"Let's hurry to the Monster Arena's Service Entrance\nto the east of Arahaghiro! We have to set the\nmonsters free!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_1_1,"If Seraphy's strategy is successful, the monsters\nwill be saved."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_1_2,"...We won't allow them to be locked up and fight to\nthe death."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_2_1,"We can't abandon those we know will be killed."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_2_2,"I bet even as a monster himself, Clawde thinks so too."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_1,"I wonder if they'll find out we're lying...? But\nthey wouldn't expect someone like {pc}\nto lie, would they."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_2,"They got a junkie-looking face, ain't they."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_3_3,"I di...I didn't mean like that! {pc}!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2, yer capable o' deceivin' people,\nain'tcha?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_4_2,"You say that as though we all do not look like liars..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_5_1,"I'm reluctant to lie, but... To avoid casualties,\nwe have no choice."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_17_1,"If we can successfully set the monsters in the arena\nfree, we can put a stop to the event!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_65_17_2,"If you show Clawde to the soldier guarding the service\nentrance and tell him that you've captured a Great\nSabrecat, he should let us into the underground cages."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_1_1,"Seraphy, you remembered something. Since we've come\nthis far, we'll stick with you until the end, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_1_2,"So... You won't have to do something reckless like\nrisking your life!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_2_1,"Oi, Seraphy! Suddenly your life might be on the line;\nwhat're you on about!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_2_2,"Sorry! I'll tell you the details later!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_1,"{pc}! Let's go with Seraphy to stop\nthe King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_2,"Thank you...! Near where the monsters were captured,\nthere is an elevator that'll takes us to the Battle\nHall."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_3_3,"Bermud should be there now... Everyone, please!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2's junkie acting somehow fooled\nthose guards; I'm pleased!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_5_1,"Seraphy, it is absolutely not a good idea to go\nalone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_5_2,"Ye... Yeah, sorry. But I have to hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_70_17_1,"Please, everyone! Lend me your power to stop Bermud!\nHe should be in the Battle Hall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_1_1,"Seraphy, she remembered your former self. I'm curious\nwhat the heck happened, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_1_2,"First we need to stop King Bermud. Seraphy should be\nwaiting for us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_2_1,"Wasn't King Bermud human? I can't believe he could\nchange into monster form like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_2_2,"Whatever, I'm worried about Seraphy. {pc},\nhurry, let's deal with King Bermud!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_3_1,"{pc}, Seraphy isn't here!... Could\nshe be trying to stop King Bermud by herself?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_3_2,"If so, we have to hurry and save her no matter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_4_1,"To think the monsters we set free were actually\nhelpin' us... That's nice and junkie, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_4_2,"C'mon! Let's go get the junkie girl back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_5_1,"That appearance of King Bermud... I sensed an intense,\nomnious power."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_73_5_2,"We cannot leave Seraphy alone! Let us head toward\nthe Arena's Battle Hall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_1_1,"We were able to put a stop to the survival deathmatch,\nbut King Bermud couldn't be saved..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_1_2,"And the fact that Seraphy was a healslime, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_2_1,"Seraphy thanked us, but I don't know if I'm glad\nthat she did..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_2_2,"If he had the guts to become the King, he should've\nfocused on protecting the monsters first...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_1,"Seraphy was a healslime? But if her being Clawde's\npartner was true, then... Raguas, you know what I\nmean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_2,"Yes, I believe so... However, it would be best to\nhear it from Seraphy directly."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_3_3,"The Monster Master monument at Murudo Mountain,\nthat's where Seraphy is waiting for us."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_4_1,"Riskin' yer life on things like revenge is stupid!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_4_2,"That said, I wouldn't even be a bit disappointed\ngivin' my life for somethin' like junk, y'know!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_5_1,"When King Bermud took on the form of a monster, he\nclaimed that it was a power bestowed upon him by\nsomeone, did he not."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_80_5_2,"Who in the world would do something like that...?\nThere are many things I do not understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_1_1,"Kalevan and King Bermud were sibling disciples..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_1_2,"I bet they trained with each other like Giganf and\nArold, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_2_1,"Seraphy and Kalevan... huh? She even said they're\ngoing on a journey too, so maybe we'll meet again\nsomewhere."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_3_1,"Seraphy and Clawde... Ah, Kalevan... As long as\nthey're together, it'll be fine, won't they?"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_4_1,"C'mon! We gotta set out in search o' new junk too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_1,"Monsters turned into people... People turned into\nmonsters; mysterious happenings in this country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_2,"Outside of the fact of the cause being the Great\nDemon Army, in the end, we do not understand any more."
PT_TALK_TXT_24_100_5_3,"However, with the bracelet that Seraphy gave us...\nIf we collect the butterflies and go to Gran Zedora\nKingdom, will we be able to learn anything?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_1_1,"Finally, Gran Zedora Kingdom, y'know. Let's focus on\ngoing there."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_1,"Oi, wait a minute, why was Mishua not stopped and\nallowed to pass through?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_2,"Just who is Mishua...? I don't even get the point\nof the 3 Butterflies and how Crows happened to show\nup..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_2_3,"Man, I don't get it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_3_1,"We did it! Now we can go to the Gran Zedora Kingdom,\nright!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_3_2,"But it seems like the 3 Butterflies were unrelated...?\nWe gave them to Mr. Crows, but he didn't use them\nfor anything, did he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_4_1,"Next up is Gran Zedora Kingdom's junk, ain't it!\nGupupupupu... I'm lookin' forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_5_1,"...Mr. Crows seems to have known from the beginning\nthat the gate would be passable."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_10_5_2,"It was as if..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_11_3_1,"Gran Zedora Castle is so big! I wonder which of the\n5 continents' castles is the most impressive?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_11_3_2,"A country's merti is not determined by the size nor\nbeauty of its castles... Nevertheless, that is\nabsolutely magnificient."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_1_1,"Mishua, even after we parted, you continued searching\nfor your memories by yourself?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_2_1,"I don't mind that Mishua girl going to Gran Zedora\nCastle, but Raska didn't follow, did he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_4_1,"I gotta hunch there's lots of little junk waitin' at\nGran Zedora Castle that I ain't even seen yet!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_1,"Ms. Mishua is a mysterious person, is she not. I know\nnot why, however I feel that she and {pc}\nare somewhat similar."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_2,"Ya think those two look alike... Finally, even yer\nstartin' ta become a bit junkie!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_15_5_3,"Ehh!? No, I am not referring to their appearances..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_1_1,"The Hero and Mishua looked just like each other,\ny'know... Could they actually be twins?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_2_1,"...She's the Hero Princess, huh! I was surprised that\nshe looked just like Mishua, but... She definitely\nlooks like a skilled person, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_3_1,"Eh? Eh? Eehhh? Why do the Hero and Mishua look\nidentical?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_1,"I ain't interested in stuff like thronerooms, so\nhow's 'bout we just explore inside the castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_2,"Duston, this is what we came here for; what are you\ntalking about? Let's go together!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_4_3,"Mukya!! Please don't say things like Chiri!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_1,"Princess Anlucia and Ms. Mishua both appeared to be\nsurprised, did they not."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_2,"Indeed, they looked so similar that it would be\ndifficult for one to believe they were not related."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_20_5_3,"Ever since we have come to Lendersia, it has been\nriddled with mysterious things, has it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_1_1,"The Princess said she hasn't awakened yet... But it\nhad to be the light that saved Giganf, Arold, and us\nback then..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_2_1,"Oi, that's not the story we were told, huh. That\ngeezer Hollow said the light we saw was the light of\nthe Hero's Awakening, didn't he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_3_1,"Mr. Hollow said that the princess of Gran Zedora was\nthe Awakened Hero, right? What does that mean...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_3_2,"That geezer likes to tell dumb jokes, but I don't\nthink he'd just lie like that. What's going on...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_4_1,"I wish she'd've lent us a warehouse full o' junk\ninstead o' a castle bedroom, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_4_2,"I am absolutely not sorry that she didn't..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_30_5_1,"When Princess Anlucia heard from {pc} about\nthe light of the Hero's Awakening, did it seem as if\nshe was somewhat angry...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_1_1,"Castle beds are so soft and fluffy, aren't they? At\nfirst, I was tense, but then I was sound asleep."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_1_2,"It would be bad to keep the princess waiting, so\nlet's get ready to go to the throne room."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_2_1,"Calling us this early in the morning, the Princess\nhere must've liked us, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_3_1,"Ahhh... I wish we could have slept a little longer."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_4_1,"Even though we was sleepin' peacefully, they woke us\nup ta summon us... A lil bad hospitality is good,\nain't it!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_5_1,"{pc}, you may still be drowzy, but let us\ngo to Gran Zedora Castle's throne room."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_40_5_2,"Even if Princess Anlucia hasn't awakened as the hero,\nhelping her is the purpose of our journey, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_1_1,"For some reason, the forecast looks grim, but...\nThis is our chance to see what the Princess' true\nability, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_1_2,"If it is dangerous, we'll help! Since that's our\nmission too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_1,"Killing a giant Red Dragon, huh... Just how strong\ncould it be?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_2,"Hyuza, there is no point in that. We are there to act\nas Mishua's escort, are we not!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_2_3,"...I know that."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_3_1,"Even with how much Mishua and Princess Anlucia look\nalike, do you think those two being together will\nbring back her memories?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_4_1,"Her lost memory made her useless and ta think she's\ngoin' through all o' this trouble ta get it back.\nShe's unworthy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_5_1,"To think that Mishua is accompanying on such a\ndangerous matter as subjugating a giant dragon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_50_5_2,"Does Princess Anlucia somehow know what the chance\nof victory is?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_1_1,"It's the Princess's orders, so we'll do our best to\nprotect Mishua, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_1_2,"Do you think actually taking her is safe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_2_1,"Should we take someone who really can't fight to a\ndangerous place, like where there's a dragon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_2_2,"Whatever, as long as we're around Mishua'll get there\nwithout a scratch. Right, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_3_1,"Mishua, when you suddenly disappeared from Melsandy\nVillage, I was so scared."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_3_2,"I'm sorry. I don't remember too much... But I felt\nlike I had to go to Gran Zedora Castle, no matter\nwhat..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_1,"Zedra Cave's giant Red Dragon...? As long as I get\nta keep all the junk, it don't matter if it's a\ndragon or whatever!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_2,"By the way, Mr. Duston, what is it about junk that\nyou like?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_3,"Because it's useless, y'know! I'd almost rather have\nnothin' than have somethin' useful; it's the best!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_4,"Huh...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_4_5,"...Don't worry about it. We still don't understand\nit too much either."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_5_1,"Now that I think about it, I still don't understand\nwhy another Mishua appeared in Melsandy Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_5_2,"However, Lady Mishua here doesn't seem to know\nanything either, so perhaps it would be best not to\npry."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_20_1,"{pc}, thank you so much for taking the\ntime to escort me."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_53_20_2,"I'll be right behind you, {pc}, so don't worry\nabout me. Let's head for Zedra Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_1_1,"Looks like the princess went ahead. Let's stick close\nto Mishua and head out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_2_1,"How's the Princess gonna take down the giant Red\nDragon... That'll be a sight to see, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_2_2,"The true strength to take on a giant Red Dragon...\nOne would certainly have to be strong, would they\nnot."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_3_1,"Defeating a giant Red Dragon... Do you think Princess\nAnlucia is okay? I just hope she isn't hurt..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_4_1,"I can't wait ta see what kinda junk this giant Red\nDragon or whatever it's called has waitin' for us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_4_2,"Bein' a giant dragon, it oughta have a huge piece of\njunk that'll be hard ta find a place ta show off, no\ndoubt 'bout it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_5_1,"The giant Red Dragon is deep inside Zedra Cave, is it.\nWe will need to be careful proceeding with Mishua."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_20_1,"I'm afraid of the giant Red Dragon, but I have a\nfeeling that just waiting around won't bring back my\nmemories."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_57_20_2,"Just one more breath. Please, let's go to the giant\ndragon's nest."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_1_1,"Mishua was originally a part of the princess?\nIf that's the case, it makes sense that they'd look\nthe same, although..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_1_2,"Anyways, we can't leave her alone like this! Let's\ngo after her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_2_1,"The Hero Princess' attitude changed fast, didn't it.\nSuddenly bursting out laughing and going on about her\nlost half?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_2_2,"I don't really get it, but we gotta go after those\nguys!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_3_1,"Hey, {pc}! Let's go save Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_3_2,"While I don't understand that Hero's power or the\nPrincess Anlucia's missing half stuff, but we can't\njust let her run off with Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_4_1,"Puttin' together a clunky girl who doesn't remember\nnothin' and a junk Hero Princess who can't awaken to\nmake them useful is unthinkable, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_4_2,"Former Junkie No. 2! We gotta stop it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_5_1,"...Princess Anlucia spoke of making preparations for\na ceremony, did she not."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_60_5_2,"Until the preparations are complete, Mishua certainly\nshould be imprisoned somewhere within Gran Zedora\nCastle."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_1_1,"From what Mr. Dyme said, it seems that the Princess\nis involved in the castle town disappearances, isn't\nshe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_1_2,"Mishua is in danger! Let's go save her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_2_1,"That Hero Princess is... What's she gonna do with\nMishua, huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_2_2,"We gotta save Mishua...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_3_1,"Everyone who met with Princess Anlucia went\nmissing... We have to hurry up and save Mishua, no\nmatter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_3_2,"Sea Breeze Cave at Reviewle Highway North is where we\ncan enter the secret passage with the key that Mr.\nDyme gave us, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_4_1,"A secret passage! There's gotta be junk there, ain't\nthere! Let's hurry to Sea Breeze Cave!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_1,"Even when Lord Dyme's grandson went missing, no one\nwas suspicious..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_2,"Could something similar our time in Melsandy Village,\nwhere we were unaware of the other Mishua that had\nappeared, be occurring?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_70_5_3,"...It would be best if we hurried, would it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_1_1,"I'm curious about Crows too, but right now we need to\nrescue Mishua first!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_2_1,"I was surprised when that Crows guy showed up\noutta nowhere, but... No point in worrying about it.\nFor now, let's get to Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_1,"Mr. Crows came to tell us something again, didn't he..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_2,"More importantly, let us focus on getting through the\nsecret passageway and rescuing Mishua."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_3_3,"Yeah. You're right!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_4_1,"That Crows guy following us around so aimlessly is\nsurprisingly junkie, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_4_2,"...Gmmmm? Could it be that he's after my junk!?\nI won't allow it! I won't allow it, y'know!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_73_5_1,"Seabreeze Cave... Being a secret passage, so we don't\nknow what may be inside. Let's proceed with caution."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_1_1,"Were those wizards involved in King Bermud becoming\na monster in Arahaghiro Kingdom!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_1_2,"There's no way... I'll absolutely never forgive them!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_2_1,"Looks like that shady geezer just disappeared! Now's\nthe time to go save Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_2_2,"Yeah! I'm worried about Mishua!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_3_1,"They said Mishua was the test subject!? Let's hurry\nand save Mishua, before something happens to her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_4_1,"Where's that junkie girl, y'know? We should keep an\neye out for junk while we're lookin' for her too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_5_1,"When King Bermud became a monster, the Gran Zedoran\nsoldiers who rushed in were under orders from that\nwizard just then, were they."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_75_5_2,"Then who was the one that King Belmud claimed had\nbestowed him his power...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_1_1,"The reason we were collecting butterflies was to\nrestore Mishua's memories, eh."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_1_2,"Only one person can enter the world of memories,\nit's frustrating to wait, but... <pc>,\nwe leave it to you."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_2_1,"Restoring Mishua's memories is up to you, alright.\nSo no screwing around, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_3_1,"{pc}, do you think Mishua will be able to\nbring back Mishua's memories? I'll cheer you on too,\nso do your best, ok!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2! Bring back some junk from that\nWorld of Memories place for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_5_1,"The purpose of our having collected the 3 Butterflies\nwas for the restoring of Mishua's memories..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_77_5_2,"How long has Mr. Crows known it would come to this...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_1_1,"No way, Mishua was the real Princess Anlucia...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_1_2,"Even that the light was the same as the one that saved\nus that one time... The light of the Hero's Awakening!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_2_1,"Oi, wait a minute! Mishua's... No, she was the\nAwakened princess!? I hardly recognized her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_2_2,"Yeah... But I feel like Mishua's face, how do I put\nit, like her kind side hasn't changed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_3_1,"Ehhh!? Mishua is the real Hero Princess? Then what\nabout the other Princess Anlucia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_3_2,"Even Mr. Crows did not seem to understand, therefore\nwe have no choice but to meet the other Princess\nAnlucia and ask her directly."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_1,"If this ain't the real Gran Zedora, then it's fine\nif I take the junk I found, ain't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_2,"You're hopeless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_4_3,"Ah come on! I helped find the Hero, didn't I!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_5_1,"I had sensed that Mishua was marvelous person, but to\nbe the True Hero; that was surprising."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_80_5_2,"However, first we need to make our escape from the\ncastle.\n<br>\nIf we follow the secret passage in the opposite\ndirection than we came, we should be able to get out."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_1_1,"Creation Magic...!? The Princess seriously plans on\nbecoming the True Hero with that...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_1_2,"Let's head to Alltrades Abbey together with the\nHero Princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_2_1,"A person who kills people like that can't be called\na hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_2_2,"Let's fight together with the Awakened Princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_3_1,"To do that to Lord Dyme, who was so kind... I won't\nforgive them! That kind of person must not become a\nTrue Hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_3_2,"Yeah. Becoming the Hero just for the power... That's\nwrong and we'll stop her no matter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_4_1,"Stealin' somebody else's power ta become stronger is\nsomethin' I'll never understand, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_4_2,"We're on the same page for once, old man... I'll never\nforgive them."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_5_1,"The false Hero Princess' words... 'Born to become the\nhero'...? And the Creation Vortex...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_5_2,"There are still many things we do not comprehend,\nhowever we must accomplish our mission to support the\nHero Princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_6_1,"To avenge Dyme and prevent any more people's lives\nfrom being taken, we must stop the other me, no\nmatter what."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_90_6_2,"In the so-called ritual chamber of Alltrades Abbey,\nlet's search for the way to the Creation Vortex!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_1_1,"Is something wrong? You look like you're not\nyourself..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_1_2,"If you need anything, feel free to let me know, okay.\nI'm strong enough to protect you, {pc}, too."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_2_1,"Oi, {pc}! You've been looking pale for a\nwhile!? Are you okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_3_1,"{pc}, since passing through the teleportal\nat Alltrades Abbey you don't seem well... Are you\nokay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_3_2,"If there is anything I can do for you, you can always\ntell me! We're friends, afterall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_1,"What the heck is that Creatin' thing. Is it some\nuseless junk?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_2,"Since it possesses a ghastly power, so I do not\nbelieve it is the junk that you are hoping for, Mr.\nDuston."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_4_3,"Mukyaaa! Mokiiii! They really are sinister guys!\nI don't like it, y'know!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_5_1,"To inform us of their location, so that we may follow\nbehind; are they confident in their abilities or is\nit something else..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_91_6_1,"The Creation Vortex... There we must absolutely put\na stop to what the other me is trying to do!"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_1_1,"False Princess Anlucia's words... Even though she was\nabandoned by the Great Demon King, she tried to fight\nagainst that fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_1_2,"Maybe she was also a victim of the Great Demon King\nand didn't even know it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_2_1,"I'm surprised... To think that since we came to\nLendersia, everything has been something made up by\nthe Great Demon King or whatever."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_2_2,"Even so... The people we have met so far... They\ndid not seem fake at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_3_1,"Raska, Firo, Seraphy-up to now all the people in the\ntowns and villages we've been to; they all were created\nby the Great Demon King...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_4_1,"This Lendersia's a fake...? Everythin' was junk,\nyou're saying?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_4_2,"Then, the one who made it, that Great Demon King guy,\nunexpectedly likes junk, right!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_5_1,"False Lendersia... That is what the indescribable\nmalaise I have felt up to now has been."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_5_2,"To think that this entire continent and all the people\nliving upon it were wholly fabrications, how in\nthe world does one have that much power..."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_1,"Great Demon King Madesagora... He created False\nLendersia to play with the people living there, as\nif they were toys."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_2,"...There are some things that bother me, but first we\nmust return to True Gran Zedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_25_130_6_3,"In Gran Zedora Castle's western tower, on the third\nfloor, in the room where I was previously imprisoned,\nlet's wait for Mr. Crows to arrive."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_1_1,"The Great Demon King's evil influence extends to\nTrue Lendersia as well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_1_2,"To prevent any incidents in this world that would\ncause anyone to do something like mourning, we need\nto search for strange phenomena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_2_1,"Look for strange phenomena... Telling us something\nvague and asking whether or not we can handle it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_2_2,"We know that Great Demon King guy is scheming\nsomething, but... It feels like we might be in a\nbit too over our heads."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_1,"True Melsandy, Celed, and Arahaghiro..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_2,"Up to now, the people we've come to meet haven't\nbeen of this world, have they?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_3_3,"That's a little lonely, isn't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_4_1,"This time, I'll find some real junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_4_2,"Can junk be fake or real...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_5_1,"This True Lendersia and False Lendersia...\nWhat sort of connection do you suppose they have?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_5_2,"If we go to the True World's Melsandy, Celed, and\nArahaghiro, perhaps we will discover something we do\nnot know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_6_1,"{pc}... Thanks to you all, I was able to\nsee my father and mother again. Truly, thank you\nso much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_10_6_2,"And as friends traveling together, please take care\nof me in the future."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_1_1,"To think she lost all memory while in the False\nWorld... Let's take her to her big brother's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_2_1,"When she regained her memory, she must've missed her\nbrother. Let's stop by his room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_3_1,"A big brother, huh... I don't have any siblings, but I\nwonder what it's like...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_3_2,".......? What're you suddenly staring at me for?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_1,"Okay then, the junk in the Princess' room..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_2,"You can't go doing something like scavenging a lady's\nroom!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_4_3,"Uggggh... That's no fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_5_1,"...We have lost far too many people to the Great\nDemon King and the Netherlord. Prince Toma being\none of them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_6_1,"Big Brother's room is on the third floor of Gran\nZedora Castle's eastern tower."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_11_6_2,"In the False Gran Zedora Castle, it was the same\nroom as the one you all stayed in."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1,"Who knew that those stone pillars that are everywhere\nhad such a role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2,"But with those we can travel between the two worlds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1,"How does Crows know so much about everything?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_2,"I understand that he appears to be our ally, but to\nthe extent of which he is aware feels somewhat eerie,\ndoes it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1,"He said we can go back and forth between both worlds!\nWe'll be able to see everyone from the kid's kingdom,\nand Raska, Seraphy, and the others, won't we!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1,"*Sigh*... Ya really like collectin' useful things, dontcha.\nI'm ashamed ta have had ya as an assistant!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1,"What is it that Mr. Crows must do...? I'm sure the\ntime will come when his fate overlaps with our\njourney again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1,"{pc}, thank you for stopping by my brother's\nroom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_2,"Make sure not to lose the Brave Stone, okay. You\nmight need it to cross back and forth between the two\nworlds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1_melsr,"The False World's Melsandy Village looks almost\nidentical, but... Something feels a bit off, doesn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2_melsr,"Please, look closely. This village's trees are not dead\nones, and none of the houses are damaged."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_3_melsr,"It's true... Prince Raguas, you really memorized it,\ndidn't you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1_melsr,"This Melsandy Village has a statue of Zankrone too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_2_melsr,"...That means there's a Zankrone here too, huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_3_melsr,"If he is in True Lendersia also, it's unlikely that Lady\nLushenda wouldn't know of him, but... I've never\nheard of such a thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_4_melsr,"Whaddya mean? I don't get it at all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1_melsr,"The village looks the same and yet, things like the\npeople we know not being here feels a little strange,\ndoesn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1_melsr,"Real or not, it doesn't matter! Only whether there's\njunk or not!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1_melsr,"The villages resemble one another, but the people\nwho live there appear to be different."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_2_melsr,"Do you think Mishua, Raska, the Chief, and Grandma\nKope are inside?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1_melsr,"This is certainly Melsandy Village, however I...\nIt's not the village where I spent time as Mishua.\nThis is an awfully strange feeling."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_1_serer,"Mr. Duston, you were quick to notice how that girl\ntakes after Liselotte."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_2_serer,"It feels like you don't notice anything but junk,\nalthough, surprisingly, you may be perfect at\nreading people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_3_serer,"Mukya!? Didja just compliment me!? Please quit it!\nIt's givin' me goosebumps!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_4_serer,"Yeah, yeah..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_1_5_serer,"Ahaha..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_2_1_serer,"The brat here looks like the Queen from the other\nCeled. It seems like the townspeople are no different\nfrom over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_3_1_serer,"A girl who looks like the Queen from False Celed...\nJust like Lady Anlucia and the Evil Hero; are they\njust different people with the same appearance?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_1_serer,"The fact that she looks exactly the same as the fake\ntown's Queen, and y'all completely missed it...\nY'all're worthy o' bein' my assistants, aintcha!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_4_2_serer,"Enough already! We told you, Mr. Duston, we are not\nyour assistants, come on!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_1_serer,"Judging from appearances, this Celed is exactly\nidentical, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_5_2_serer,"Nevertheless, it appears that there are adults in this\ntown as well. What in the world is the distinction..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_6_1_serer,"Alltrades Abbey's own city, the town of Celed...\nBut the people appear depressed, don't they. How\nabout we look around for any strange phenomena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_1,"Doing something like stealing someone's things; those\nare some troublesome monsters, y'know. What use would\nthey have stealing stuff like wheat flour?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_2,"Do monster bake bread too, I wonder...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_1_3,"I can't imagine they do..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_2_1,"She said the wheat was stolen by monsters; weird, huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_2_2,"I don't know for sure, but depending on the situation,\nmaybe we should treat it as one of the strange\nphenomena, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_3_1,"Is Airi not feeling well? I hope she gets better soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_4_1,"Stealin' bread before it's baked; impatient monsters,\nain't they. Can't hate 'em for that, can ya!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_5_1,"Assisting Airi might lead to a clue in our investigation\nof this region's strange phenomena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_6_1,"Melsandy Village's wheat... It reminds me of the\nFluffy Bread that Grandma Kope baked."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_10_6_2,"Come on, let's get rid of the monsters that stole it\nand get back the wheat!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_1_1,"Beautiful wheat, right. I wonder if False Melsandy\nVillage had wheat just as pretty."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_2_1,"Now that we've recovered the wheat from the monsters,\nlet's hurry up and grind it into flour at the\nwaterwheel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_3_1,"With that we got all the wheat back, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_4_1,"Turnin' grass like this into tasty bread; the one who\nthought that up must've been a good-for-nothin',\nuseful guy, ain't he!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_5_1,"Stealing harvested wheat; what truly terrible monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_20_6_1,"The next step is to turn the wheat into flour, okay.\nAt Melan Waterwheel, let's use the flour mill."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_1_1,"I feel a little nostalgic for the time we went to the\nFalse World's Melan Waterwheel to pick up Grandma Kope."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_1_2,"And us all cleaning up the stream... To think that\nLendersia was made up, I still can't believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_2_1,"I'm starting to want to eat some bread made with\nthis flour too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_3_1,"This flour's sure to make some super tasty bread!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_4_1,"This world's waterwheels aren't junky, ain't they?\nThat's a shame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_5_1,"It takes considerable effort to make even one loaf of\nbread. This has been very enlightening."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_30_6_1,"Now that we've finished with the flour, let's go give\nit to Airi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_1_1,"Smells good... That's some super tasty-looking bread,\ny'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_2_1,"The smell of that bread's making me hungry. Let's\neat something after."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_3_1,"Wow... Airi's baked bread looks very delicious..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_4_1,"If the bread was hard and bitter, I'd happily eat it,\nbut it ain't, is it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_5_1,"Now we need only to deliver this bread to Mr. Lappett\nin the town square, yes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_5_2,"So long as no major strange phenomena have occurred\nin Melsandy Village, it shall be all good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_40_6_1,"Grandma Kope's bread was soft and very delicious,\nalthough, Airi's bread looks delicious too, doesn't\nit."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_1_1,"The hand monster and Zankrone's catchphrase too; that\nwas our same struggle, wasn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_2_1,"What's the hell's going on!? The events in that\nvillage were all made up, weren't they!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_2_2,"Does that mean we actually experienced the tale of\nthe fictional world...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_3_1,"The mysterious travelers who were with Raska...\nCould that have been about us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_3_2,"B—but that can't be true, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_4_1,"We came to see a picture-show? That's a nice, junky\nexperience!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_5_1,"What happened in that village... Our experience,\nbecame a picture-show, although, were we within the\npicture-show...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_5_2,"The strange phenomena... Could this be it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_50_6_1,"Grandpa Lappett's picture-show... What in the world\ndoes this mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_1_1,"The story of our experience has been turned into a\nfairy tale, and there's a sequel to it...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_1_2,"I'm really curious, but the fact that it's a sad ending..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_1,"Sad ending? We should've defeated that Hand Monster,\nright?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_2,"After we got rid of the Hand Monsters, maybe another\nscary thing happens?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_2_3,"If that's the case, then we'll have to defeat the monsters\nagain."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_3_1,"The mysterious traveler from the fairy tale and\n{pc} have the same name... Then it's just\nas we thought..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_3_2,"But we didn't do anything like meeting Airi's\ngrandfather, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_4_1,"I guess we got put up in the VIP Room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_4_2,"It don't matter which Melsandy Village, they both\nlike to treat me harshly, don't they!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_5_1,"If our experience is a fairy tale in this world, then\nwhat is the sad ending that lies ahead?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_6_1,"If Raska and the others that appear in the fairy tale\nhave a sad conclusion..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_392_200_6_2,"There may be some connection with the other Melsandy\nvillage. Let's try to ask Airi again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_1_1,"I'm worried about Airi's disappearance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_1_2,"If those giant rabbits are involved, we need to find\nher quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_2_1,"Giant rabbits? You don't think it's those guys we met\nin False Melsandy, do you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_1,"She said Airi chased after some giant rabbits!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_2,"But Airi said that she can't walk around too much.\nI hope she's okay... I'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_3_3,"{pc}, let's go find Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_4_1,"Giant rabbits? That's definitely gotta be them useless\nguys, ain't it! Let's go find it right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_5_1,"The giant rabbit she mentioned, could it be...?\nNo, for now let's search for Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_6_1,"I'm worried about Airi. Let's go find her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_10_6_2,"I wonder if someone in the village saw where she went\nto?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_1_1,"Those rabbits are in this world too; I have a bad\nfeeling about this, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_1_2,"Let's get Airi before the rabbits do something to her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_2_1,"The bad rabbits, eh... After all, it's those guys who were\npicking on the Man O' War, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_2_2,"I don't get why they're in this world, but Airi might\nbe in danger. We have to hurry up and find her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_3_1,"Airi was chasing after those bad bunnies after all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_3_2,"{pc}! If we don't hurry, they'll pick on Airi like\nthey did the Man O' War!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_4_1,"Naughty big, bunnies! Dark cave next to the square!\nThis is great, ain't it! I'm lookin' forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_5_1,"This world's Sunbeam Square should be west of\nMelsandy Village as well, should it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_5_2,"However, in that world there were no such caves.\nLet us proceed with cautioun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_6_1,"The False World's Sunbeam Square had no place such as\nRabbani Hole."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_13_6_2,"In both worlds, there are similar things and different\nthings... For what purpose...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_1_1,"Those rabbits are definitely the ones from before at\nthe waterwheel; they're naughty monsters, aren't\nthey..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_1_2,"If the False World is from the fairy tales, then why do\nyou think they're in this world too...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_2_1,"Those rabbits are the naughty rabbits from the fairy\ntales? What's up with that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_3_1,"{pc}, I'm glad Airi is safe, you know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_3_2,"But since she went outside by herself, we have to\nfollow her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_4_1,"Oho! They're right, aren't they! The way that snack\ntime is more important; what a junky style!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_4_2,"I'm gettin' more 'n' more interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_5_1,"Because Airi also said that they were the rabbits from the\nfairy tales, then—as we expected—they are from\nthat time at the waterwheel..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_5_2,"Although they are unable to use the Bravestone, how\ndid they arrive here from the False World, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_20_6_1,"To think that the rabbits from that time are in this\nworld as well... What is going on?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_1_1,"Since he recognized us, he clearly the real Zankrone,\nright."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_1_2,"Do you think that characters from fairy tales appearing\nis this village's strange phenomena?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_2_1,"I'm worried about Airi, but if she's left with Zankrone,\nshe'll be fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_2_2,"Still, meeting Zankrone in this world was unexpected,\nhuh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_1,"To think that we met with Zankrone again... And\nZankrone seemed healthy, didn't he!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_2,"But... Uhh? Zankrone was a fairy tale character, wasn't\nhe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_3_3,"In the False World's Melsandy, did we meet the real\nZankrone?...Uhh, I'm totally confused."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_4_1,"A hero that small, able to carry someone, I've got no\nbusiness with someone like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_4_2,"He's amazing, isn't he... Just what you'd expect from\nMelsandy Village's hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_5_1,"To think that the naughty rabbits and even Zankrone\nhave come to this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_5_2,"Do you think False Melsandy Village was only created\nto be an imitation of the fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_1,"...Zankrone completely forgot about me, didn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_2,"It appears that all the people of Melsandy Village have\nforgotten about Mishua... Rather, Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_3,"But we remember you perfectly! Right, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_30_6_4,"...Thank you, everyone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_1_1,"Looks like Airi overdid it a bit chasing after those rabbits,\ndidn't she. I hope she feels better soon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_2_1,"Airi collapsed, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_2_2,"She looked sickly to begin with. I guess she used up all\nher strength chasing after the rabbits..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_3_1,"Is Airi okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_4_1,"Mukyaah!! Again, we got put up in the VIP Room..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_4_2,"I can't believe someone like me's an important customer,\nwhat a junky inn, ain't it!... Wait a minute, I've\nreconsidered!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_5_1,"Where do you believe Zankrone went somewhere after\ndelivering Airi?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_5_2,"Like in the False World, he appears just in nick of\ntime from Goddess-knows-where, does he not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_393_200_6_1,"I'm worried about Airi, you know. Do you think that her\nhealth has improved any since then?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_1_1,"Those rabbits lured Zankrone into this world... They\nmight give us some kind of hint, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_2_1,"We gotta get those rabbits to talk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_3_1,"He said we needed jam and butter to catch the bunnies!\nWhen they're spread on bread, it looks so tasty,\ndoesn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_4_1,"Those junkie bunnies are rabbits, and yet they like\njam and butter... They're smellin' even more nice 'n'\njunky!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_5_1,"To think that the rabbits' favorites are jam and\nbutter, as if from a fairy tale; it is charming, is\nit not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_5_2,"Those naughty rabbits aren't what I'd call charming,\nthough."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_6_1,"The Hero Zankrone we know is the one from the fairy\ntales, after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_10_6_2,"But what does mean that his personality is slightly\ndifferent?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_1_1,"Airi holds the key to solving the mystery in the fairy\ntale's sequel, there's no doubt! Let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_2_1,"A witch who tears apart heroes... We'll have to brace\nourselves for something ugly looking. {pc},\ndon't let your guard down!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_1,"Hero Zankrone said that his body was dismembered by\na witch..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_2,"Then, the dismembered body parts were attacking the\npeople of Melsandy Village..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_3_3,"That's so sad! {pc}, let's help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_1,"Those precious junkie bunnies got smoked! That's why\nI hate things like heroes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_2,"But, originally, it was Hero Zankrone's ear, wasn't\nit?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_4_3,"Then, ya're sayin' that junkie thing was the Hero,\nyeah!? He's great, ain't he!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_5_1,"Dismembering the village's hero and transforming said\nparts into monsters to attack the village... What a\nterrifying witch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_30_6_1,"Let's go back to Airi's place. Maybe we can learn\nsomething about the witch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_1_1,"A witch will bring eternal night to Melsandy village...\nWhat does that mean, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_1_2,"Anyway, looks like there's no way but finding that\nwitch, y'know. Let's go, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_2_1,"I don't really get the jumbled details between the\nFalse and True Worlds, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_2_2,"I won't forgive anyone tormenting Airi or Raska like\nthat! {pc}! Let's kick that Witch's butt!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_3_1,"Airi... Before her life ends, she said she wants to\nsave everyone in the village..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_3_2,"{pc}! Let's get rid of the evil witch and\ngive Airi peace of mind!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_4_1,"A witch like that's gotta have junk with her, ain't\nthat right! So, when's she comin', eh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_5_1,"When shall the witch arrive and how shall she destroy\nthe village...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_5_2,"Soon, Airi shall have composed herself and we can\nhave her explain this fairy tale witch, do you concur?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_394_200_6_1,"Melsandy village... And Airi, we can't leave them like\nthis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_1_1,"The witch's weakness is chickens... Whether or not that's\nthe truth, we don't know, but for now we'll try\nbetting on that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_2_1,"Chicken are her weakness, huh... That witch might be\nsurprisingly weak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_2_2,"...A witch that will try destroying Melsandy Village\nbeing scared of something like a chicken is surprising,\nisn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_1,"{pc}, I'm glad we know the witch's weakness!\nBut why's something like a chicken her weakness?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_2,"Is she weak to the chicken's crows... Or something akin\nto that, do you believe? I, too, become quite surprised\nwhen nearby loud crowing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_3,"Heeey, Raguas, you don't like when chicken crow. To\nme it means, ""morning's come!"", it's nice, I love\nit."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_3_4,"N-no! I only mean that being near loud sounds as such\nsurprise me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_4_1,"Somethin' like a chicken is her weakness; she's\nawfully junkie, ain't she! I like her a lil!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_5_1,"The witch's weakness...! As Airi said, there may be hope\nto change the fated destruction!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_6_1,"Now that we know the witch's weakness, she won't do\nanything like destroying Melsandy Village."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_10_6_2,"Now, let's go, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_1_1,"Zankrone's dismembered body parts were attacking the\nvillagers... We don't know what the Witch will do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_1_2,"Hurry, let's get back to the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_2_1,"I didn't expect Zankrone to be blown so far away...\nIn the end, that witch won't be so easily defeated,\nhuh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_3_1,"To think that the chicken wasn't her weakness... Melsandy\nVillage will be destroyed! {pc}, what do we\ndo!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_4_1,"Ta think that Witch's stronger than the Hero,\ndisappointin', ain't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_4_2,"Enough! This is not the time to say things like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_5_1,"Hero Zankrone's... Sins? Did something happen between\nthat Witch and him before, do you believe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_6_1,"To think she told us to, ""tell everyone of the\ndestruction and horrors that await them""... But the fact\nis, there's nothing we can do other than talk to Airi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_40_6_2,"Let's go back to Airi's place. If it were possible,\nas she is now, I wouldn't want to talk with her about\nthis, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_1_1,"Like Anlucia said: without hope, we can't fight\nagainst cruel fate..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_1_2,"We'll absolutely defeat the Witch. For Airi... For the\nvillagers, to give them hope."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_2_1,"No one's blaming her for misunderstanding the\nweakness, and yet... Airi, don't push yourself into a\ncorner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_2_2,"For the crushed Airi and the villagers, we've got no\nchoice but to defeat the Witch!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_3_1,"I'll do my best! To give Airi hope!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_3_2,"First... What do we do? Other than Airi, who's someone\nthat knows the fairy tale enough to ask about the\nWitch?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_4_1,"If it were me, just looking at junk would give me\nenergy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_5_1,"Let us all restore hope to Airi and Melsandy Village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_395_200_6_1,"{pc}, lend me your power too. I want to show\nAiri hope."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_1_1,"It's the gem that we also found in the False World's\nMelsandy, isn't it. In this world, Lappet has it,\ndoes he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_1_2,"If we show it to Airi, I wonder if she'll cheer up."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_2_1,"In the fairy tale, Zankrone loses to the Witch, and\nthe rest of the story hasn't been written..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_2_2,"Does that mean this time Zankrone will lose to the\nWitch just like in the fairy tale?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_3_1,"The gem Mr. Lappet gave us has a powerful shine,\ndoesn't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_3_2,"If we show Airi the gem, maybe she'll feel better!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_1,"I ain't interested inna gem like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_2,"If Duston's saying that, then is this the real deal\nafter all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_4_3,"MOKYAAAH!! Don't use me for bein' useful, please! Use\nme for bein' useless, please!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_5_1,"This red gem that Mr. Lappet entrusted to us... Do you\nbelieve it is the true version of the one that we\nreceived from the Man O' War in the False World?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_10_6_1,"This gem we received from Mr. Lappet... It looks kind\nof familiar, doesn't it. Perhaps it's the true soul\ncrystal?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_1_1,"...What the!! {pc}! Hurry, let's go to the\nWitch's place and rescue Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_2_1,"Damned Witch... I won't forgive you!! Oi, {pc}!!\nRight away, let's head for the Witch's mansion!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_3_1,"{pc}, this is serious! Hurry, we have to go\nsave Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_4_1,"The Witch's mansion! There's gotta be some unbelievable\njunk, ain't there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_4_2,"Former Junkie No. 2! Hurry up 'n' head there! Little\njunk's waitin' for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_5_1,"""Go south of Rhone Forest to the Banquet Hall in the\nWitchwood"". I am certain that is what the Witch was\nsaying."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_5_2,"Inviting us as such, it must be some sort of trap,\nhowever... No, now is not the time for speaking of such\nthings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_6_1,"Witch Gretzel... How despicable...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_20_6_2,"{pc}, let's go save Airi!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_1_1,"Hero Zankrone... He was truly worthy of being called\na hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_1_2,"With Hero Zankrone around, I think either Melsandy can\nlive in peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_2_1,"Hah! Just the impression you'd expected of a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_2_2,"With Zankrone cheering on Airi, she seems to have the\nwill and a dream to live for; so, for now, it's a\nhappy ending, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_3_1,"Amazing! As expected of Hero Zankrone! Airi was safe\ntoo, I'm really happy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_4_1,"Even without a heart, he's fine wit' it; I don't know\nwhether that's super or junkie, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_4_2,"It's startin' to get interestin'!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_5_1,"I am truly glad that Airi is in high spirits...\nI, too, am feeling spirited!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_6_1,"It's unfortunate that the Witch escaped, but Airi was\nsafe, so, for now, we can feel at ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_30_6_2,"All that's left is to escort Airi back to Melsandy\nVillage."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_1_1,"The Tale of Hero Zankrone still has a ways to go with\nAiri taking over..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_1_2,"I'm super sure it'll become the village's great hope\nand continue on forever... What a lovely thing, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_2_1,"That Airi girl's gotten much better, huh. Brats should\nbe like that, shouldn't they."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_2_2,"Then let's quickly defeat the Great Demon King and\nmake sure this peace lasts forever. Right, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_3_1,"Grandpa Lappet said, ""Little Airi is looking completely\nbetter"" and seemed overjoyed, didn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_3_2,"I wonder what kind of story Airi's next tale will be?\n{pc}, I'm looking forward to it, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_4_1,"If we keep lookin' for strange phenomena in the world,\nmy place'll be full o' junk like that Witch's mansion,\nain't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_4_2,"C'mon, let's move on to the next!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_5_1,"With how Hero Zankrone encouraged Airi's heart, False\nMelsandy Village, too, I am certain shall be saved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_5_2,"Those possessing courage and hope, in order to protect\npeople, must not waver... I, too, must become like\nhim...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_6_1,"If Airi continues writing hopeful stories, even if\nthe witch tries something again, Hero Zankrone will\nsurely help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_396_200_6_2,"He truly was a hero, wasn't he. I must continue to\ndo my best to be worthy of being a Hero too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_1_1,"There are a lot of things I don't understand, but\nFirst, let's go get the shiny book\nback."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_2_1,"It's hard for an old drow man to clean up the pile of rubble all by himself.\nIsn't there anyone who can help?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_3_1,"The Queen's Church\nwould have been destroyed in this world...\nBut it's a different world, so it doesn't matter, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_3_2,"Oh, don't think it doesn't matter..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_1,"Leave the shiny books\nto the former Junkie No. 2\nI want to dig under the rubble too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_2,"I'm sure some rare junk will come out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_4_3,"...Hey {pc}.\nIs Mr. Duston always like this?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_5_1,"The church on the hill is reduced to rubble...\nHowever, the other church seems to be safe.\nIs there a meaning behind this difference?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_10_6_1,"It's important to investigate incidents, but\nwe can't ignore people who are in trouble.\nLet's get back the books stolen by the monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_1_1,"This is a super glittering book, right. Let's take\nit to Mr. Drow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_2_1,"A book that sparkles like this... No wonder monsters\nwant it; it's an easy mark, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_3_1,"It's a very lovely, glittering book, isn't it...\nI wonder who the owner is...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_4_1,"Insteada glitterin' book, how 'bout a musty, tattered\none, y'know? If it's unreadable, even better!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_5_1,"This Glittering Book... Could it be someone's\ndiary...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_20_6_1,"Since it must be someone's prized possession, let's\nquickly get it back to its original owner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_1_1,"A book that other people shouldn't read casually...\nUnlikely that it's an ordinary book then, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_1_2,"The owner of the book may be worried about it. Let's\ngo to the mayor's house on the west side of town."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_2_1,"That means the Glittering Book belongs to the town\nmayor, huh?... No way."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_3_1,"I wonder what was written in the Glittering Book..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_3_2,"I'm super curious..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_4_1,"I ain't interested in the whoever the owner o' that\nGlitterin' Book is, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_4_2,"Insteada that, if we're goin' ta the mayor's house,\nI'd like ta see if there's any good junk there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_5_1,"This book is the mayor of Celed's... No, let us\nnot pry too much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_30_6_1,"Let's deliver the book to the mayor's house. While\nwe're there, he might be able to tell us if there's\nany strange phenomena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_1_1,"She said, 'a memento, left behind by Liselotte'.\nWhat does she mean by that...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_1_2,"Lucolia... She was saying to the mayor that she\nwanted him to visit her sister's grave... Is there\na grave?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_1,"That mayor shouldn't treat Lucolia so coldly. What's\nhe so busy with that he can't go without yelling at\nthe kid."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_2,"...Let's hurry outta this house and talk to that\nold guy, Drow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_2_3,"He might know something about the Queen's memento\ntoo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_3_1,"As mayor, he shouldn't be getting angry like that at\nLucolia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_3_2,"Thinking back on my father and I's past... I don't\naccept that even a little bit."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_4_1,"What's so bad 'bout a kid bein' a useless disgrace?\nI wish that'd Chiri would follow that example!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_4_2,"Ooh, you're talking a little like a respectable\nperson...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_5_1,"The relationship between the two worlds... But what\nin the world is that diary, that was said to be left\nbehind by Liselotte...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_1,".......Such a thing did happen in False Celed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_2,"Here, a child who is thought to be dead, is there,\nalive."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_40_6_3,"I wonder why in the world did the Great Demon King\ncreate False Celed?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_1,"The kids of Celed are dead, and Lucolia is the sole\nsurviving child..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_2,"But, in the False World's Celed, Liselotte, Firo,\nand the others all seemed to be doing well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_1_3,"The Great Demon King based the children he created\non the ones who died...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_2_1,"The brats in the Fake World's Celed, were already\ndead...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_1,"I was kinda understood Lucolia said, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_2,"The Queen is dead..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_3_3,"Hearing it again, I'm just so shocked..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_4_1,"Dead, but alive; what kinda junk is that, I don't\nget it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_5_1,"When we defeated the Evil Hero Princess, I believed\nthat we had solved the mystery of the False World,\nbut... The mystery has only deepened."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_6_1,"Just as the Great Demon King created the Evil Hero\nPrincess, he created the dead children as false\ncitizens of Celed...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_397_200_6_2,"Therefore, that explains why the adults and Lucolia\nwere not in that town, does it not... It's a sad\nstory, though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_1_1,"Is Lucolia maybe aware of the other world, I wonder...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_1_2,"Since she's knows about it, that's why she entrusted\nus with such an important letter, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_2_1,"She was really on about us delivering the letter to\nLiselotte directly, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_2_2,"Now that we know that she is deceased, how should we\nconvey that to her... I'm worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_3_1,"Lucolia knew about the honorary children thing,\ndidn't she."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_3_2,"Did the Queen and her used to talk about it, I wonder..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_4_1,"I'm a Dishonorable Adult, so I'll leave the deliverin'\nletters and bein' a useful person thing to the Honorary\nChild, former Junkie No. 2."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_4_2,"The reason I'm goin' with ya is ta make sure there\nain't any junk I overlooked, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_5_1,"I am curious about the letter we are to deliver to\nLiselotte. Surely, we shall discover something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_5_2,"As one exits Celed, there is a Bravestone Tower,\nwhere we may travel between both worlds, is there not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_6_1,"I wonder how Lucolia found out about {pc}\nand you all...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_10_6_2,"Was it the diary we gave her, that was buried under\nthe rubble of the church."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_1_1,"I wonder what Liselotte will think when she reads the\nletter from Lucolia..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_1_2,"I don't know what's written, but I'm sure the Queen will\nunderstand the feelings contained in the letter."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_2_1,"That Liselotte girl... Hearing that they had died,\ninstead of being sad she was angry, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_2_2,"Since it did not appear that she was keeping back\ntears from us all, do you believe those were her true\nfeelings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_3_1,"The Queen... Hearing the story of how you all died\nmust have been shocking, wasn't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_3_2,"Suddenly hearing something like about how you died\nand being shocked by it is only natural, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_4_1,"Doesn't look like there's anymore notable junk in\nthe town of only kids, Celed, ain't there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_4_2,"If ya're gonna make somethin' like a fake world, I\nwish ya'd put more junk in it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_5_1,"In the end, the adults' disappearance being due to\nLiselotte's failed ritual was merely that monster's\nlie, was it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_6_1,"True Lendersia and False Lendersia... Hearing such a\nstory so suddenly, there's no way one would believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_20_6_2,"At any rate, the letter has been delivered, so let's\nreturn to Lucolia's place."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_1_1,"As expected, in False Lendersia's Celed, the children\nwe met were all those who had died, weren't they..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_1_2,"But why is that we were the only ones who could see\nthose kids..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_2_1,"The brats at the other Celed are all dead, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_3_1,"That diary was an precious book that connects Lucolia\nand the late Queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_3_2,"{pc}, I'm glad you found the diary among the\nrubble, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_4_1,"Not only was that diary shiny, but it was also useful...\nI'm glad we delivered it so quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_5_1,"I had believed that both worlds are more than merely\nsimilar, however, to think they are connected as such\nvia the diary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_1,"A connection with your deceased sister... Huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_2,"......."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_398_200_6_3,"As for me, I'm okay. Thanks to {pc}, I was\nable to say my final farewell to Big Brother Toma..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_1_1,"Here's the wool...I've only heard\nthat it's used for tailoring, but I wonder what\nyou're asking the tool shop for?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_2_1,"...I don't like it, but\nI'm the old man of Lucolia.\nI'll do at least a favor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_3_1,"It's high-quality wool...\nIt looks really warm.\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_4_1,"High-quality wool!\nJust hearing something like that gives me chills!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_4_2,"It looks warm though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_5_1,"Are you in such a hurry to ask\nus, even though we've only met once?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_10_6_1,"Mayor\nAre you going to make warm clothes?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_1_1,"The dead children shouldn't be holding any grudges\nagainst the adults. But a little while ago, the\nchurch illusion and that kid's voice...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_2_1,"...The broken down church's illusion and the supposedly\ndead brat's voice... Celed has nothing but strange\nthings going on, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_3_1,"{pc}... We saw the collapsed church, my eyes\nweren't playing tricks on me, were they...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_4_1,"To think that the church collapsed 'n' right after,\nit was back to normal... Awfully junkie experience,\nain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_5_1,"That illusion of the collapsed church... In False Celed,\nthe church at that location, if I recall correctly,\nwas similarly damaged, was it not?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_5_2,"Do you believe that it appeared in this world as an\nillusion? If so, why...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_6_1,"The supposedly dead children live in another Celed...\nEven saying so, they wouldn't believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_50_6_2,"At least, I wonder if we can convince the adults that\nthere are no grudges beared against them?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_1_1,"These downhearted people—we shouldn't worry them,\ny'know. We'd better better keep quiet about the church."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_2_1,"About the vision at the church... The mayor told us to\nkeep it from the townies; I get why too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_2_2,"If the adults panic any more, it'd be hard for them\nto keep it together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_3_1,"If we tell the townspeople about the church, they\nmight suffer even more than they are now, that's why,\nisn't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_4_1,"Some junkie ghost like that who just laughs... That's one\nI'd wanna be my assistant, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_5_1,"Despite what has happened, Mayor Burat's attitude\ntowards considering the citizens is admirable, is it\nnot. I, too, must follow his example."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_399_200_6_1,"Showing visions to torment people who have lost their\nfamily like that; I wonder if that's part of the\nGreat Demon King's plan too...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_1,"The townspeople are important too, so I get why he'd\nwant to hold a meeting, but I wish he'd spend more\ntime caring for Lucolia, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_2,"How can the mayor not cherish Lucolia who survived..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_1_3,"With how their father-daughter relationship is, I\nfeel sorry for Liselotte too. Somehow, I'd like to do\nsomething about it, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_2_1,"Believing that the adults are never coming back, and\nthose kids, even now, still pray..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_1,"The mayor only ever scolds Lucolia, doesn't he..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_2,"The mayor also has a duty to protect the townspeople,\nso he might be busy and putting off dealing with his\ndaughter, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_3_3,"I kinda understand that, but... I feel sorry for Lucolia,\nwho cares so much about the Queen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_4_1,"I ain't interested in stuff like Peaceful Incense,\nbut if there's junk that makes ya feel sick, I'll\ntake it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_5_1,"The Peaceful Incense is dropped by Elder Dragons in\nthe Lyana Desolation Zone, is it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_5_2,"We know not origin of the illusion, therefore—no\nmatter how slight it may be—giving the people a\npeaceful state of mind is now what we should do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_6_1,"When I think about Lucolia and the parents who lost\ntheir children, my chest hurts..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_10_6_2,"Since I know how painful and sad it is to lose\nsomeone precious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_1_1,"We obtained the Peace Incense. Let's go to the mayor\nof Celed's room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_2_1,"We got the Peace Incense, huh. I guess it's important\nto use at the meeting? We gotta deliver it to the\nmayor of Celed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_3_1,"If the Peace Incense's there, will it keep everyone\nin town's anxieties away a little?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_4_1,"This is the this the Peace Incense! Its stink's a\nlittle addictin', ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_5_1,"The Peace Incense...... Has a indescribably mysterious\naroma, does it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043off_6_1,"With this Peace Incense, the people of Celed should\nbe given peace of mind, however..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_1_1,"Like the memo said, shall we go deliver the Peace\nIncense to the Assembly Hall?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_1,"Already started preparing for the meeting, huh?\nWhat an impatient mayor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_2,"His consideration for everyone in town is so much,\nthat it compels him to do such a task, does it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_2_3,"Before everyone in town, he should deal with his own\ndaughter..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_3_1,"The mayor seems super busy, doesn't he... {pc},\nlet's go deliver the Peace Incense directly to the\nAssembly Hall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_1,"The mayor's a slave-driver, ain't he! Makes me look\nlike I'm helpful, don't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_2,"That's what ended up making you angry, Duston..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_4_3,"...Hey, {pc}, with such a tone in how Duston\nspeaks, is he okay...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_5_1,"Mayor Burat is very busy, is he not. Although, once\nthe meeting has come to an end, he should have time\nto speak with Lucolia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_6_1,"The Assembly Hall is located west of the water pump,\non the other end of the tunnel, alongside the cliff,\nwas it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_20_flag10043on_6_2,"{pc}, let's go deliver the Peace Incense."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_1_1,"That medium... Calling the dead children's ghosts evil\nspirits like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_1_2,"Saying something so contemptuous about kids longing\nto see their parents, I won't forgive him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_1,"...The mayor should listen to Lucolia's words already."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_2,"Shes knows the best about being a kid after all...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_2_3,"Even if the mayor doesn't believe us, he should want\nto believe her...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_3_1,"Lucolia doesn't lie like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_3_2,"The mayor believes in a total stranger, that medium..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_4_1,"Durin' the meeting when it smelled weird, everyone\nhad a junkie look on their faces."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_4_2,"We shouldn't've gave them such good junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_5_1,"After burning the Peace Incense during the meeting,\nI felt a somewhat absentminded."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_5_2,"Perhaps we all were used by that man, Sadak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_6_1,"None of the children were resentful, and yet to think\nthat they became evil spirits, how cruel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_400_200_6_2,"We better be weary of that medium, Sadak, shouldn't\nwe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_1_1,"We don't have a clue about the diary, so for now,\nlet's try asking the people of Celed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_2_1,"She said to look for the diary too, huh... Well, it was\na pretty flashy diary, so if someone in town saw it,\nthey might remember it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_3_1,"That's terrible! If the diary's lost, so is the\nconnection between Lucolia and the Queen!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_3_2,"{pc}, let's help her find the diary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_4_1,"To think we haveta keep screwin' 'round lookin' for\nthat diary... Not just former Junkie #2, but the whole\nparty's getting used to be junkie, ain't y'all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_4_2,"...I cannot deny that, however the diary is an important\nitem related to the strange phenomena in Celed. Let\nus properly search for it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_5_1,"She suspects it is one of those 4 people... No, we must\nnot make any assumptions, should we. To begin, let us\nlisten to their stories."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_6_1,"The missing diary is an important connection between\nLucolia and her sister, so somehow I want to find it\nfor her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_10_6_2,"If I lost Big Brother Toma's keepsake, I couldn't\nthink about other people's problems."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_1_1,"As expected, that medium took Liselotte's diary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_1_2,"I can't believe he'd rob the precious diary that is\nthe bond between Liselotte and Lucolia... Hurry, let's\ngo to Rinja Tower!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_2_1,"That medium stole the brat's stuff, huh... I knew that\nguy was shady."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_3_1,"To think that he stole the Queen and Lucolia's\nprecious diary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_3_2,"{pc}, for the both of them, we definitely\nhave to get it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_4_1,"This diary gets stolen a lot, don't it. What's so\ngood 'bout such a glitterin' book?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_5_1,"That diary complicates the ""children turned evil\nspirit"" fabrication, does it not?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_5_2,"Regardless, let us go to Rinja Tower and recover the\ndiary!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_20_6_1,"Lucolia can't go alone. Let's hurry to Rinja Tower\ntoo!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_1_1,"The medium's purpose is to merge False Celed with\nthis side's Celed..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_1_2,"We can't allow him to deceive everyone in town!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_2_1,"I won't forgive that Sadak bastard! Hurry, let's go\nto Celed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_1,"The precious diary... It was burnt up..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_2,"St-still! We may not have been able to protect the\ndiary, but the townspeople still have time! We won't\nlet that medium do what he wants!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_3_3,"{pc}, let's hurry up and return to Celed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_4_1,"This world'll get merged into the False World; what\nthe heck is gonna happen?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_4_2,"This world's gonna become junk too... That's what he\nwas talkin' 'bout, yeah?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_5_1,"I'm curious about the masked man who was instructing\nSadak as well, however... First, let us prevent the\nFalse World's merge!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_6_1,"Who is that black masked man...? No, now's not the time\nfor this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_30_6_2,"{pc}, let's quickly return to Celed Town to\nstop Sadak's plan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_1_1,"For now anyway, let's try going with the townspeople\nto Alltrades Abbey's chapel."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_2_1,"We went through the trouble of defeating that Sadak\nbastard, and yet it's still not over yet!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_3_1,"We defeated Sadak, and yet the merge still hasn't\nstopped...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_4_1,"Junkie daughters gettin' in the way o' junkie\nmonsters! And he fooled the junkie dwellers! Nice\ntown, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_4_2,"The monster being junkie's the only part I'll agree\nwith you on..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_5_1,"As Lucolia said, let us go to Alltrades Abbey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_5_2,"As those who are aware of the two Celeds, we must see\nthis to the end..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_6_1,"Thanks to Lucolia, we were able to prevent Sadak's\nscheme."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_40_6_2,"But as Lucolia said, if the merge is not over yet...\nLet's quickly go to Alltrades Abbey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_1_1,"The children's prayers have finally been answered.\nThey may have ended up separated again, but they were\nable to say goodbye; I'm truly happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_1_2,"And Lucolia got a doll from Liselotte, so... Yeah, now\nit's okay, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_2_1,"To think she reunited the dead brats with the adults...\nLucolia's a great girl, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_3_1,"Even though the mayor was awkward, he really was\nthinking about the Quee—about Liselotte, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_3_2,"...It made me wanna go see my dad too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_1,"How could She only let them see each other for a just\na bit; I knew it, that Goddess is junkie, ain't She!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_2,"If that were true, She wouldn't've let them meet at\nall. Even if it was just for a little bit, they're\nhappy, aren't they, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_4_3,"Hmph! It's like that, ain't it... Man, I love the idea\nof ​​a junkie god though, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_5_1,"In the end, they were able to tell each other their\nfeelings. That much was good, I believe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_5_2,"...However, the thought of merging the False World.\n<br>\nAs expected, it is unlikely the Great Demon King is\ncontent with the making of his own world alone, is\nit not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_401_200_6_1,"The people of this town, I'm certain, are fine now.\nFinally, they were able to convey their important\nfeelings after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_1_1,"It doesn't seem like\nthe battles between monsters are really exciting here at Arahaghiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_2_1,"Is this the true Kingdom of Arahaghiro?\nCompared to the False World of Arahaghiro,\nit doesn't seem to have changed much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_3_1,"The wind here in Arahaghiro is also very hot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_4_1,"It would be great if there was also a ruin here in Arahaghiro that was blessed with\njunk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_5_1,"In either world\nIt's hot in the Arahaghiro Kingdom...\nI hope we can find a clue soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_1,"I have met King Moonis of the Arahaghiro Kingdom before\n, but do you know anything about the incident?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_2,"Now that I think about it, even in the fake world,\nthe Grand Zedora Kingdom and the Arahaghiro Kingdom seem to have had\ncontact."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_3,"However, the purpose was to use\nKing Bermud and the others as experimental materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_4,"To abuse the bond between two countries in such a distorted way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_0_6_5,"I don't know what the Great Demon King is planning, but\nI will absolutely stop it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_1_1,"Drink the water from the\noasis in front of the monster fighting arena...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_1_2,"I don't know what's inside the pot, but\nI can't leave it alone, so let's go to the monster fighting arena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_1,"You said something like, 'Let that pot drain the water...."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_2,"You look weak, but\nit's kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_2_3,"It looks like there's something in the pot.\nShould I bring you some water?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_3_1,"It was kind of a creepy pot, but...\nIs it okay to do as you say?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_3_2,"...But the voice inside the pot\nseemed to be in a lot of pain."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_4_1,"A talking pot would be useful, but\nIt's just a bunch of crap that just wants water!\nThat's just how I like it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_5_1,"It was a suspicious pot, but\nI can't just leave it alone.\nLet's deliver water from the oasis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_10_6_1,"I feel like I heard that voice from that pot\nsomewhere...\nI'm sure it's just my imagination."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_1_1,"Let's deliver the Oasis Water to the talking pot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_1_2,"I'm really curious about what the thing inside the pot\nlooks like..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_2_1,"The guy in the pot was had a pretty harsh voice, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_2_2,"{pc}, let's hurry up and bring him the water."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_3_1,"What in the world is in that pot, do you wonder...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_3_2,"I did not sense anything bad. I hope that by bringing it\nthe Oasis Water, we will get an understanding of its\ntrue form...."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_4_1,"That weird pot that seems to want water... Is it bad to\njust take it home?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_5_1,"I feel reluctant about using the precious Oasis Water\non a mysterious black lump, however..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_5_2,"It may result in a clue to investigating Arahaghiro\nKingdom's strange phenomena."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_6_1,"As it requested, we received the water; although I\nwonder what's in that pot?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_20_6_2,"The voice I heard from the pot... I feel as though I've\nheard it somewhere, but... Umm, where, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_1_1,"If such a big seaweed monster went to the castle,\nwouldn't it cause a big fuss...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_1_2,"I'm a little worried. Let's go after him, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_2_1,"...The monster called itself the King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_2_2,"It went back to the kingdom, but... You think it'll be\nokay going back like that?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_1,"There was a king inside the pot, and that king is a\nseaweed monster...!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_2,"That seaweed monster king said he was returning to\nthe castle!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_3_3,"{pc}, would it be okay if we left it as is?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_4_1,"Come on! Hurry up and follow after that seaweed!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_5_1,"For—for the time he was unshriveled, he appeared\nhealthy, that is good, is it not..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_1,"I met King Moonis when I was still small, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_2,"Despite both being kings, I remember thinking that he\nand my father were very different, even now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_402_200_6_3,"I feel as if that monster's personality and voice seemed\nto resemble King Moonis at that time, but... Is it\ntrue, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_1_1,"If you're calling Mr. {pc}'s name,\nit's definitely the monster that came out of that pot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_2_1,"The monster the minister is talking about is\nthe one who calls himself King Sama\n, isn't he talking about wakame...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_2_2,"If it's that wakame monster,\nit's only natural that there will be an uproar..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_3_1,"I'm just calling out {pc}'s name, so\nthe seaweed monster king\nmust have been in a lot of trouble..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_1,"I'm sure it's that seaweed!\nIt's a nice chunk that won't disappoint!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_2,"Former Junkie No. 2!\nI'm so jealous that you like me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_3,"Come on!\nFrom the side entrance of the fighting arena\nI'll go see Wakame!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_4_4,"Hey {pc}...\nIsn't Duston's enthusiasm\na bit unique...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_5_1,"The one calling {pc} is\nthat seaweed king,\nI'm glad he hasn't been exterminated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_6_1,"Did that seaweed monster\njust enter the Arahaghiro Kingdom and get captured?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_0_6_2,"I feel like the King Moonis I know would do\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_1_1,"Looks like he's upset that he can't prove that\nhe's the King, so let's get the scepter back for him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_1_2,"It doesn't matter if he's really the King or not,\nkeeping him locked up in a cage like this makes me\nfeel a little guilty."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_1,"Even if that seaweed monster is the King, in that\nmonster form, nobody would believe the guy, don't\nyou think..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_2,"If we don't get the scepter back for him, the King\nwon't be able to get out from the inside of that cage!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_2_3,"Even if it's a monster, the country needs a king,\nI guess... Let's go get the scepter then."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_3_1,"For now, being all seaweedy like he is, nobody would\nbelieve he was the King, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_3_2,"I still can't believe it either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_4_1,"If I say I'm gonna take it, ya think that they'd let\nthe Kelp King outta the cage for us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_4_2,"...Doing that would end up with us having to take him\nalong on our journey, right? I'd like to avoid that,\ngot it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_5_1,"Having known of the scepter, could it be that he is\ntruly Arahaghiro's King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_5_2,"Perhaps..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_6_1,"Certainly, the real King Moonis also had a golden\nscepter. Then, after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_10_6_2,"{pc}, let's go to the south of the\nArahaghiro region and take back the scepter."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_1_1,"The scepter we took back should get the people of\nArahaghiro Kingdom to believe him, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_2_1,"We got the scepter back. Then let's take it to that\nseaweed guy's place."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_3_1,"That scepter should get the King to convince everybody\nthat he was the King after all, shouldn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_3_2,"Hurry, let's go to the Monster Arena's Basement to\ndeliver it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_4_1,"All golden and shiny like, a sorry excuse for a stick,\nain't it! It don't suit that seaweed guy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_5_1,"Well, it is fine that we recovered the scepter,\nalthough with that, do you believe that it shall\nprove he is the genuine King Moonis?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_6_1,"Let's deliver the Golden Scepter to King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_20_6_2,"Despite the appearance, I believe he's the real King\nMoonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_1_1,"I feel a little like the story went in a weird\ndirection, but... It was really King Moonis, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_1_2,"With that, the king's back, so I bet the ministers\nand soldiers are happy too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_1,"I'm glad that seaweed guy got them to believe that he\nwas the King, but... He didn't need that scepter, did\nhe, huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_2,"Spilling his subordinate's secrets like that, so they\nhad to believe him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_2_3,"It means that King Moonis watches his subjects closely.\nIn a sense, I think it is an ideal relationship of mutual\ntrust."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_3_1,"Even without the scepter, a suggestion from Raguas\nwould've made them believe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_3_2,"In either case, the scepter will still be necessary\nin the future, therefore... Having recovered it had\npurpose."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_4_1,"That seaweed guy... If we couldn't've convinced them\nthat he was King, I would've liked to adopt him,\ny'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_4_2,"Still, a country where a seaweed guy is king is\nawfully nice and junky, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_5_1,"I am glad that the minister and captain were convinced\nthat he was the bonafide King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_5_2,"Supposing that had he no concern for his subjects, he\nmay still have been inside that cage now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_30_6_1,"I knew he was the true King Moonis after all.\n{pc}, thank you for believing me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_1_1,"Humans transformed into monsters... That's like the\nstory Seraphy told us in the False World."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_2_1,"Like that Kelp King, there's guys who're suffering\nfrom being transformed into monsters, are there..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_2_2,"Hurry, I wanna find the people who went missing and\nbring them back home."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_3_1,"So that the all the soldiers who got transformed into\nmonsters quickly get returned to normal, let's all\ncooperate with King Moonis!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_4_1,"Even though I thought he was just some rare junk,\nsurprisin'ly, he's a worthy King, ain't he; still...\nI'm a lil disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_5_1,"King Moonis greatly considers those whom are his\nvassals, does he not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_5_2,"In order to become a worthy king, I, too, must follow\nhis example."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_403_200_6_1,"Transforming captured people into monsters like that...\nWhat is the Great Demon King scheming, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_1,"In order for the King to return to his original form as\nsoon as possible, let's escort him to Kudus Spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_2,"What a dependable one you are, young lady. I look\nforward to working with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_3,"Maiyu is the daughter of Rangao Village's Village King.\nIncidentally, Fuura, too, is the daughter of Azlan's\nfeudal lord."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_4,"Raguas, you say that as if you aren't Megistris'\nPrince. Lady Anlucia is also a princess!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_1_5,"Hohoh! You all are, surprisingly, a good lot of young\nmen and ladies. Mmm! As good as they get!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_1,"Kudus Spring deep in Jyra Jungle, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_2,"King or not, tagging along with a guy who looks like\na monster feels weird, but... Now that we've agreed\nto it, we'll protect you properly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_2_3,"Hyohoho! You're reliable, cool guy! I look forward to\nworking with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_1,"Escorting the King to Jyra Jungle's Kudus Spring..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_2,"Can I protect him properly, I wonder? I'm nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_3_3,"Everybody's here and, Fuura, you're strong enough.\nSo it's OK."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_1,"We're returnin' this rare seaweed guy back into a\nhuman!? What a waste!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_2,"I've come to getting used to this body, but if I\nremain a monster, one way or another, it'll interfere\nwith managing national affairs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_3,"That's good, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_4_4,"No...? You're a fascinating fellow to have along,\naren't you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_5_1,"A sacred spring that can break the shapeshifting\ncurses... Still remaining within the historical record\nis excellent, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_5_2,"It's all thanks to the minister, Caboose. He writes\ncorny love letters from poems, but he's good at his\njob."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_1,"When I last saw King Moonis' face, he had a kind,\ncharming aura. I hope he can return to his original\nform soon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_2,"Even if he can't turn back, that's fine, ain't it.\nI like the seaweedy face he's got now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_10_6_3,"Yeah...? E-even so, I don't think we can leave him\nlike that... Right, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_21_1,"{pc}, if it's you guarding me, then I don't\nhave to worry about anything on the way to Kudus Spring\nin Jyra Jungle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_21_2,"You're my lifesaver after all. I'm counting on you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_1_1,"King Moonis has returned to his original form, so he\ncan finally appear in front of his people, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_1_2,"Now, let's go to True Arahaghiro Kingdom's throne room.\nKing Moonis is bound to be waiting for us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_1,"Just soaking in Kudus Spring easily returned him to\nhis original form, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_2,"...He didn't look much different to me though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_2_3,"Felt like his whiskers and stuff didn't change much\nfrom when he was seaweed, did they..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_3_1,"With Kudus Spring, the King returned to normal, but\nit seems like he didn't change much, did he...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_3_2,"{pc}, what did you think?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_4_1,"It's too bad that the seaweed guy turned back into a\nhuman, but he gotta give us some junk as reward, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_4_2,"Former Junkie No. 2! Quickly, let's go get the reward\nat the former Kelp King's place!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_5_1,"Even after King Moonis returned to his human form,\nhis presence did not change much, did it. Not only his\nappearance, but his cheerfulness as well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_5_2,"Even having transformed into a monster, he can maintain\nhis cheerful character... That, too, may be the quality\nof a King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_20_6_1,"I'm glad that King Moonis returned to his original form.\nI only hope the other people who were turned into\nmonsters can also be found."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_1_1,"We've found a way to get back them back to their\noriginal forms. Let's cooperate and help find the\nmissing people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_2_1,"The missing guys, like the King, are suffering from\nbeing transformed into monsters, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_3_1,"Like with King Moonis, I hope the missing soldiers\ncan be returned to normal, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_4_1,"Soldiers and monster masters who've been turned into\nmonsters... Mugugu...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_4_2,"Well, not worth worrying about, ain't it! Instead of\nthat, let's look for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_5_1,"King Moonis is a very considerate person, is he not.\nFor that reason, I would like to support him, would\nyou not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_6_1,"Is there any more info regarding the missing soldiers,\nI wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_404_200_6_2,"If we meet with King Moonis again, we may be able to\nask him something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_1_1,"Hearing Maleika's story made me wanna find Kalevan\nquickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_1_2,"When Arold disappeared, I felt that weight myself..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_1,"Monster Master Kalevan... If I remember correctly,\nthat was the name of the sabrecat with Seraphy, when\nhe was a human, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_2,"We should inform Seraphy of the story we heard from\nKing Moonis, should we not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_2_3,"No choice but to go to the other Arahaghiro and meet\nwith Seraphy, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_3_1,"A monster with a cross-shaped scar on its left eye,\nhe said... Kalevan, is the the sabrecat who is with\nSeraphy, isn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_3_2,"{pc}, let's go to the False World's Arahaghiro\nKingdom! Let's go meet Seraphy and him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_4_1,"Kalevan...? If ain't junk, I ain't interested!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_5_1,"A monster with a cross-shaped scar on its left eye\nnamed Kalevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_5_2,"I do not believe this is unrelated to the events of\nFalse Arahaghiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_1,"Everyone has someone in mind regarding Kalevan, it\nseems. Could you tell me too?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_2,"......."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_3,"...Right. Someone we met during those things in False\nArahaghiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_10_6_4,"Let's try verifying that by meeting up with Seraphy\nand him in False Arahaghiro Kingdom!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_1_1,"For his wife and son, I want Kaleven to see them as\nsoon as possible, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_1_2,"In front of False Arahaghiro Kingdom, let's go to the\nBravestone Pillar!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_2_1,"We're going to the Bravestone Pillar in front of\nArahaghiro Kingdom? Hurry, let's go, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_2_2,"We need to hurry up and bring Seraphy and him back to\nthe True World. Kalevan's family's waiting for him to\ncome home."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_3_1,"{pc}, I want to help Kalevan meet his family\nquickly, okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_4_1,"There's all kinds o' junk lyin' 'round near Arahaghiro\nKingdom. I love it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_5_1,"All that remains is to return Kalevan to the True\nWorld and lift the curse upon him, yes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_5_2,"Which reminds me, Seraphy was originally a healslime\ntoo, was she not. Shall we lift Seraphy's curse as\nwell?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_6_1,"The Brave Stone will be useful in bringing Kalevan and\nthe others back to True Arahaghiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_20_6_2,"Now, quickly, let's go to the Bravestone Pillar in\nfront of False Arahaghiro Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_1_1,"I wonder if we gave them Kalevan's cameo, if it\nwould ease his family's worries, even just a lil bit."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_1_2,"Even if Kalevan can't go home, having that's gotta\nreassure his family."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_2_1,"Devil's Rooster, huh... Heh, should be monsters with\nsome bone there, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_3_1,"The monster that stole Kalevan's cameo is in Devil's\nRoost, she said... That's a little scary of a name\nfor a place, isn't it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_4_1,"Devil's Roost! Can't be helped; gotta be junk in a\nplace with a name like that, ain't there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_4_2,"C'mon! Let's go to Devil's Roost to look for junk!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_5_1,"We may have to battle the monster whom stole the\ncameo. Let's take care going to the Devil's Roost."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_1,"Even with the Bravestone's power, to think that we\ncan't bring Kalevan and the others back to the True\nWorld."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_2,"If Crows were here at a time like this, he might have\ntold us something, but since we don't even know where\nhe is..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_30_6_3,"For now, let's begin with recovering Kalevan's cameo\nand make Mareika feel at ease first, okay."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_1_1,"Kalevan's message will let his family keep having\nsomething to believe in."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_1_2,"""I'll definitely come home soon"", he promised,\ndidn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_2_1,"...That Sweet Troll said she had a date with someone.\n...Who in the world could that be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_3_1,"That Sweet Troll who stole Kalevan's cameo is\nfashionable, isn't she."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_3_2,"Now that you mention it, I think there is something we\ncould probably learn from her fashion-wise."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_4_1,"With a name like ""Devil's Roost"", I figured they're\nbe lovely junk here, so much for that, right..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_4_2,"I, too, have learned a lesson... All sorts..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_5_1,"To deliver the cameo, let us return together to King\nMoonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_1,"She was a bit of an unusual monster, wasn't she..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_2,"Ah, instead of that, let's deliver the cameo to\nMaleika."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_40_6_3,"Not knowing whether or not your special someone is\neven still alive, I'm sure has to make one feel\nterribly anxious..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_1_1,"I hope Kalevan reunites with his family soon, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_2_1,"It's good we delivered the cameo, but... If possible,\nI'd like to bring back the guy himself, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_3_1,"Even if we delivered the cameo and message, it's no\nsubstitute for Kalevan himself, you know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_3_2,"Hurry, to bring Kalevan back, let's lend our strength,\nokay, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_4_1,"Even I have faith that we'll run across some lovely\njunk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_5_1,"King Moonis still appears to have something in mind,\ndoes he not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_5_2,"Later on, let us trying listen to what he has to say.\nA clue to bringing Kalevan home may come of it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_405_200_6_1,"I'm glad Maleika feels relieved. Even while apart,\nit's precisely because they believe in each other,\nisn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_1_1,"If the True and False World's Naseem Cave are\nconnected, it worth a try, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_1_2,"Let's go to the False World's Arahaghiro to meet with\nSeraphy and Kalevan again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_2_1,"Doing this should bring Seraphy and Kalevan back to\nthe original world, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_2_2,"And then Kalevan can see his family again, right.\nI'm glad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_3_1,"Yay! Like King Moonis said: if the Naseem Caves are\nconnected, Kalevan and Seraphy can home to the\noriginal world!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_3_2,"Hurry, let's tell Seraphy and Kalevan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_1,"I can't tell if the two worlds bein' connected is\nuseful or useless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_2,"Is that so. I do not know whether that is a good or\nbad thing either, but... There is a possibility that\nwe can bring back Kalevan, so I am glad."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_3,"Mukya!? Pl-please stop it! Havin' the same opinion\nas someone like you is like me bein' a well-mannered\ngent, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_4_4,"Eeh!? Excuse me for that...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_5_1,"Bringing Kalevan and the others back to the original\nworld is a duty that only we, who can freely travel\nbetween both worlds, can do, no."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_5_2,"Kalevan will be back with his family before long."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_6_1,"The two worlds may be connected via Naseem Cave,\nare they."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_10_6_2,"If so, the people of the True World like Kalevan and\nthe others now living in the False World should be\ninformed too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_1_1,"The way for Kalevan to see his family again is opened,\ny'know. C'mon, let's go to Naseem Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_1,"That cave where the Sweets Troll lady was has a\nsecret, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_2,"I bet it's overflowin' with secret junk, no mistakin'\nit! I'm lookin' forward to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_2_3,"...Old man, that's really is all there is to you.\nMeh, can't say that there won't be junk though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_3_1,"Kalevan and Seraphy will be back home in the original\nworld soon, I'm sure of it, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_4_1,"Even I thought there was still somethin' suspicious\n'bout Naseem Cave. Until we find some junk, we can't\ngo back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_5_1,"Seraphy and Kalevan have headed towards Naseem Cave,\nhave they. We, too, should make haste."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_5_2,"The place where the two worlds are connected,\ncertainly, shall be difficult to find. Let us\ncarefully investigate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_6_1,"If the demons who kidnapped Kalevan and the others are\nusing Naseem Cave to move, we need to be careful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_20_6_2,"Be careful, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_1_1,"Seraphy, why... You wanted to go back to the original\nworld with Kalevan, didn't you...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_2_1,"Why'd Seraphy do something like that... She might\nnever see Kalevan again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_2_2,"Just Kalevan getting sent home... Her staying in the\nFalse World... Did she plan all that or something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_3_1,"Seraphy... I wonder why you didn't go back home to\nthe original world with Kalevan..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_4_1,"She couldn't read or write, and yet she studied\nenough to write a letter... I'm disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_4_2,"Still, if Kalevan knew that, I'd bet it'd make him\nhappy. Ain't that right, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_5_1,"King Moonis, who was investigating True Naseem Cave,\nshould discover Kalevan."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_5_2,"Let us go meet with King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_6_1,"Those monsters closed the transfer gate... They said\nit was a mission from Demon Marshal Zeldrad, didn't\nthey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_30_6_2,"Demon Marshal Zeldrad... Big Brother Toma's nemesis!\nIf only we knew his whereabouts, this time I'd do it\nfor sure...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_1,"Seraphy... Without telling him how you felt, you sent\nKalevan back to the original world..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_2,"She chose to do so considering Kalevan, and the\nmonsters and humans left behind in False Arahaghiro..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_1_3,"Should Seraphy ever be in trouble, we shall help her\nfor a second time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_2_1,"That Kalevan guy seemed lonely, but he won't fight\nSeraphy's will and choice..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_2_2,"We all should lend a hand as much as we can, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_3_1,"Seraphy's strong will prepared her to go a different\npath than Kalevan, didn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_3_2,"Yeah. You can't go doing something like protecting\neverybody half-heartedly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_1,"I had high hopes for that Healslime girl, then she\nhad to go and be so useful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_2,"If protectin' that other Arahaghiro's what makes her\nhappy, then I'm fine wit' it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_4_3,"...Duston, you're really telling the truth, aren't you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_5_1,"Family is a good thing, is it not. I am truly glad\nthat Kalevan reunited with his family..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_1,"The Great Demon King... And the demons..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_2,"Not only did they take Big Brother Toma's life, but\nalso those cruel things to the people of Arahaghiro\nKingdom up to now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_20_406_200_6_3,"I don't know what they're scheming, however I won't\nlet you do what they like anymore!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_1,"Melsandy Village, Celed, and Arahaghiro Kingdom. The\ninvestigation of the 3 regions is over, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_2,"When I think back on the True World and False World...\nI feel like they were very intricately connected."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_1_3,"In any case, let's report our investigation to Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_2_1,"Looks like the Pendulum of Fate has enough power.\nWe gotta return to the castle and report to Sage\nLushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_3_1,"{pc}, let's go report our investigation\nresults of the strange phenomena to Sage Lushenda!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_4_1,"What the—that Pendulum o' Fate thing is? A rock wit'\nthe power to help people like that, please don't\nbring it near me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_5_1,"With the 3 region's strange phenomena investigation,\nthe Pendulum of Fate appears to have gained power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_5_2,"Melsandy, Celed, Arahaghiro—we were able to alter\ntheir fates... Why is that, do you think."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_6_1,"I registered my room in the Zoomstone, of course, you\nremember that, don't you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_6_2,"To report to Lady Lushenda, I think we will need to\nreturn to Gran Zedora Castle often from now, so put\nit to use."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_1_1,"Like Lushenda said, Hollow makes his way to lots of\nplaces, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_1_2,"First, how about we try guessing where he is and start\nour search there?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_2_1,"That geezer Hollow's never in one spot, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_3_1,"Hollow loves traveling too?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_3_2,"Perhaps while he travels to various places, he lends\nout his wisdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_4_1,"Sage Hollow...? AAH! That guy that talks 'bout that\n""tracks o' destiny"" gobbledygook..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_4_2,"I love weirdos like that, but ta think he was some\nbrilliant guy that's helpful ta society; I misjudged\nhim!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_5_1,"Master Hollow's location. I recall, if I am not\nmistaken..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_5_2,"During the decisive battle with the Netherlord Nergel,\nwe met him in the Landon Mountains, and at the ship\nbureau in Port Town Lendor...\n<br>\nNow, neither of which appear unlikely, do they not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_6_1,"I've met Hollow several times as well, but... As for\nwhere he is now, I don't know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_10_6_2,"{pc}, don't you have somewhere in mind? For\nexample... The place where you first met or something..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_1_1,"If we don't receive the Hollow's research results, we\nwon't even be able to report to Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_1_2,"{pc}, let's gather the Purifying Herbs and\ngive them to Hollow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_2_1,"If that Ogre sage asked him, why didn't he prepare\nthe research materials sooner, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_2_2,"Hollow's busy with a lot of work too. Let's collect\nthe Purifying Herbs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_1,"Hollow probably forgot about the research that\nLushenda asked him to do..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_2,"Forgettin' 'bout an important request like that is\nawfully junkie style! He's got good points, ain't he!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_3_3,"...If I got a compliment like that, I think I wouldn't\nbe happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_4_1,"I knew it, that senior sage's useless, ain't he? I'm\nhappy for him, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_1,"I am delighted that the Grand Titus is now able to\ntravel to True Grand Zedora Kingdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_2,"With that, those who know nothing of False Lendersia\nwandering into it shall lessen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_5_3,"As one would expect of a sage."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_6_1,"Considering Hollow's a sage, doesn't it feel like\nhe's a bit easygoing, or should I say he gets kinda\ncarried away?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_20_6_2,"Still, I love him. The only one who calls me Annie\nis Hollow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_1_1,"Since Hollow seemed to be unusually troubled, let's\nhurry up and go give him the Purifying Herbs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_2_1,"Right away, let's hand over these Purifying Herbs to\nthat geezer Hollow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_3_1,"I wonder what kind of research the Purifying Herbs\nwe collected will be useful for...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_1,"Purifying herbs, eh. If it were me, insteada somethin'\nlike that, I'd..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_2,"Want Polluting Herbs... Right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_3,"No, if it's the old man, it'd be Muddy Herbs, huh...\nI don't know if there really is such a thing though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_4_4,"If you two're done predictin' what I'd wanted to say...\nDefinitely, somethin' useless like that would be great!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_5_1,"Research involving Purifying Herbs... Considering the\nname of the material, do you believe it is a medicine\nfor the ridding of curses?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_5_2,"Sage Lushenda requested it, therefore I believe\nthere is no mistaking that the research will be\nuseful to society."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_6_1,"With that, we can deliver the Purifying Herbs to Hollow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_30_6_2,"I wonder if we board the Ark of the Earth again, will\nwe meet him?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_1_1,"We gotta bring the important research results to\nLushenda. Still, I wonder what kinda research it is..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_2_1,"It the geezer Hollow's research results, right... It's\nthe geezer's work, so I'm worried he accidentally\nscrewed it up."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_3_1,"I wonder what kind of research Lushenda asked Hollow\nto do...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_4_1,"That senior sage may be brilliant, but I can't hate\nhim, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_4_2,"Like ya, former junkie #2, he's got an indescribable\njunkie smell."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_5_1,"I am curious about Master Hollow's research results,\nhowever we must not secretly look at them, therefore,\nlet us deliver them to Lady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_6_1,"Lady Lushenda never seems to ask Hollow for difficult\nresearch, so I was a bit worried, but now I'm relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_40_6_2,"All that's left is give Hollow's research results to\nLady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_1,"Hollow's research results were a secret elixir for\npreserving food."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_2,"Rangao Village is super cold, so we preserve food by\nfreezing it, but it's interesting to see a different\npreservation methods."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_1_3,"Lots of parts of our lives are supported by the power\nof the sages' research like that, I guess."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_1,"That Milt guy, why's he so aggressive towards Anlucia...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_2,"It's okay, Hyuza. To Milt, I... Yeah, there's nothing\nto be done about it, so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_3,"...Hmm. Well, if you don't feel comfortable saying why,\ndon't force yourself to answer. But don't forget that\nwe're your friends."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_2_4,"...Thank you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_3_1,"Hollow's research results were amazing, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_3_2,"If one can eat cold food with the same taste as\nfreshly prepared, it should make lots of people happy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_1,"That Milt guy, I ain't likin' how he's complainin'\nabout the Hero!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_2,"Even the old man says some sensible things sometimes,\nhuh. I don't like his attitude either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_3,"My ways are useless and yet, why don'tcha complain\nabout me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_4_4,"...We always have, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_5_1,"The sages, in order to improve the livelihoods of\npeople, research everyday, do they."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_5_2,"...Incidentally, Milt's attitude. Even if he has\nconsiderable expectations for Princess Anlucia, he's\na tad harsh, is he not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_1,"............"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_2,"Big Brother Toma... I......"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_408_200_6_3,"...Ah, {pc}. I, as the Hero, must act\naccordingly, so I apologize. Let's continue to\ninvestigate Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_1_1,"The Queen... She seemed troubled not having finished her\ncloak, didn't she. Let's help her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_2_1,"The Queen ordered a cloak, huh... I'm curious to see what\nthe completed cloak will look like."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_2_2,"Let's go hear the story at the armor shop, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_3_1,"{pc}! The Queen seems to be troubled, so\nlet's help her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2, ya only do what ya're asked,\ndon'tcha. If ya were useless like me, nobody'd ask\nyou about requests."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_2,"Ah, Duston, I think even you—here and there—are a\nreliable traveling companion though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_3,"Heeey! The He-He-He-Hero Princess praised me! How\ndefeatin'! Former Junkie No. 2! Please criticize me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_4_4,"Ah... Ah, did I say something wrong...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_5_1,"I wish to reciprocate Queen Julia's feelings for\nPrincess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_6_1,"I understand Mother's concerns, but everyone is with\nme, so I have nothing to be worried about."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_10_6_2,"{pc}, thank you for your continued support."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_1_1,"In order to not keep the Queen waiting, let's quickly\ndefeat the monsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_2_1,"The materials are hard to get; that means there's\ntough monsters to fight, huh... Heh, I can show off my\nskills."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_3_1,"Moonlight Golden Thread, hearing the name alone, you\ncan tell how beautiful it is, y'know. Hurry, I want\nto see it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_4_1,"The Watchtower, yeah? I don't know what it's watchin'\nout for, but climbin' that high up, it'd probably be\neasier findin' far off junk, ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_4_2,"We're not climbing the Watchtower, we're defeating\nmonsters near it, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_5_1,"Valuable thread for an embroidered cloak... Certainly,\nit shall be a gift for a special someone, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_20_6_1,"The Watchtower is located south of Grand Zedora\nKingdom. Let's focus our search on the monsters near\nthere."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_1_1,"Golden Moonlight Thread... It's super pretty, isn't it!\nDefinitely a worthy material for the cloak that the\nQueen ordered."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_1_2,"Hurry, let's deliver it to the armor shop, so they\ncan complete the cloak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_2_1,"Collected the requested amount of Golden Moonlight\nThreads, huh. With this much, we won't have any\ntrouble making a cloak."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_2_2,"Hurry up, let's go to the armor shop, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_3_1,"Super pretty thread... With this, it should make for an\nelegant cloak, won't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_4_1,"I ain't interested in shinin' threads, so please hurry\nup 'n' deliver them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_5_1,"I hope the Queen shall be delighted with the mantle\nmade from this lovely thread."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_30_6_1,"All that's left is to deliver the Golden Moonlight\nThread we collected to Renken at the armor shop."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_1_1,"The Queen's bound to be looking forward to cloak's\ncompletion. Let's go back to the castle and tell the\nQueen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_2_1,"Once the cloak's done, I bet the Queen'll be happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_3_1,"I hope the cloak is completed soon and we can see the\nQueen's happy face, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_4_1,"I hope the reward's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_4_2,"Eh?... Duston, I feel like you'd be happy with any junk\nin Gran Zedora Castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_5_1,"All that remains is to report to Queen Julia. Queen\nJulia's private chamber, if I am not mistaken, is on\nthe 3rd floor of Gran Zedora Castle, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_40_6_1,"Mother's request has been completed as well. With\nthat, I only hope this will put Mother's mind—even\nif just a little—at ease."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_1,"The resolve Prince Toma had to protect his little\nsister, he was a fine man, wasn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_2,"We all have to inherite that resolve too, and from\nnow on protect Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_1_3,"Thank you, Maiyu. I'm relying on you all. But... Please,\nlet me protect everyone too, okay."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_2_1,"For Anlucia, Prince Toma fought long until the end\ntoo, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_2_2,"Yes. That's why I will become a fine hero, to not\nbring shame to my big brother's name."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_3_1,"Queen... I wonder how she felt when she were told that\nPrince Toma was standing in for Anlucia..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_3_2,"Either way, one of her beloved children went through\ndanger... Such a feeling, to us, is unfathomable..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_4_1,"I ain't interested in Royal Tombs! After all, there\nain't nothin' but valuable things!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_5_1,"The commissioned cloak was an offering to the late\nPrince Toma, was it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_1,"Hey, {pc}, I have a request too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_2,"My Mother is going to offer the cloak at the Royal\nFamily's Tomb at Reviewle Highway North; I'd like\nus to go there together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_3,"Big Brother Toma used to say, he was proud to protect\nme himself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_50_6_4,"That's why, for my Big Brother Toma's sake, I will\nbecome a fine hero, to not bring shame to the legend.\nThat is what I want to say in front of his grave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_1_1,"Who stole Prince Toma's body...! The Queen and\nAnlucia shouldn't have to mourn over and over...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_2_1,"...The Queen totally collapsed. Before anything else,\nwe ought to head back to the castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_3_1,"Why would Prince's body be missing, I wonder..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_3_2,"...Umm, whatever the reason, we have to look for the\nPrince's body!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_4_1,"Ta steal a dead body, ya just can't help some guys!\nEven I wouldn't do somethin like dat!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_5_1,"I have heard about royal tombs being prime targets\nfor grave robbers. By no means did I expect something\nlike the theft of Prince Toma's body..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_5_2,"Queen Julia and Princess Anlucia are already grieving,\nthis act is too much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_6_1,"To steal Big Brother Toma's body... Why would someone\ndo such a heartless thing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_60_6_2,"...I'm alright, apart from worrying about my mother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_1_1,"I hope this doesn't put any more stress on the Queen's\nbody and mind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_1_2,"{pc}, we must do what we can about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_2_1,"...We'll keep our promise on being quiet about what\nwe saw in the Royal Tomb. We gotta find Prince Toma's\nbody right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_3_1,"I hope the Prince's body is found soon, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_3_2,"{pc}, if there's anything we can do to help,\nlet's do something!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_4_1,"When a grave's been robbed, it starts glowin' like\nthat; this Pendulum of Fate thing's a piece of junk,\nain't it, yeah?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_4_2,"The theft of Prince Toma's remains has an important\nrelation to our fates... That is what it may indicate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_5_1,"Although it must be heartbreaking for Queen Julia,\nshe is enduring, in order to prevent those around her\nfrom worrying, is she not..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_6_1,"...As Mother said, if we make too much of an uproar,\nwe'll never find the one we're looking for."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_23_411_200_6_2,"Leave the search for Big Brother Toma's body to Captain\nNogato. Let's report to Lady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_1_1,"Let's go get the water, grass, and stone from the\nplaces in the False World where the pendulum pointed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_1,"The Sage's errand was for water, grass, and stone, huh.\nIt's a pain, but we got no choice but to do it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_2,"How's Sage Lushenda going to perform an investigation\nwith those?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_2_3,"About that. The Sage has foresight that we couldn't\neven imagine, right. If we tried, we wouldn't get it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_3_1,"What kind of investigation is Sage Lushenda going to\ndo with water, grass, and stone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_3_2,"I'm sure it'd be amazing research that I wouldn't\nunderstand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_4_1,"Water, grass, 'n' stones, eh... Maybe, she's jealous of\nmy junk collection, ain't she?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_4_2,"I don't think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_5_1,"The items necesary for the investigation are not\nextraordinary, however gathering them is something\nthat only we with the Brave Stone can do, is it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_6_1,"The places where the items are to be gathered from\nthe False World are the Wald Headwaters, Rhone Forest,\nand Defel  Wasteland, are they."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_10_6_2,"And it doesn't seem necessary to fight monsters, so\nlet's collect them quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_1_1,"We did our best and collected it all, but... What does\nordinary water, grass, and stone have to do with the\nstrange phenomena?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_1_2,"From all appearances, they do not seem to be extra-\nordinary items, do they..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_2_1,"...Water, stone, and grass... The Sage's errands were\nsurprisingly easy, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_2_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle and give the Sage\nwhat we gathered, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_3_1,"Water, grass, and stone... We gathered everything,\nright! To give them to Lady Lushenda, let's return to\nGran Zedora Castle!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_4_1,"I found lotsa things too! How about this weird-smelling\nwater! Dirty-looking grass! Hard to handle stone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_4_2,"...What? Keep makin' that face 'n' I won't show ya!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_5_1,"With such innocuous objects, she can understand what\nis occurring to the world; as expected of a Sage of\nhighest order of wisdom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_6_1,"The False World's Wald Headwaters Water, Rhone Forest\nBelt Grass, and Defel Wasteland Stone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_20_6_2,"With those, we have everything necessary for the\ninvestigation. Let's report back to Lady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_1_1,"I'm worried about those soldiers who were sent to\npick up the chemicals haven't returned, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_1_2,"If the soldiers are in trouble, let's help them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_2_1,"The chemicals are kept safe in the treasury, huh... Must\nbe some valuable stuff."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_2_2,"I'm worried about the soldiers too, so let's go to\nthe Royal Treasury, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_3_1,"Without the chemicals, Lady Lushenda can't do her\nresearch, and she's worried about the soldiers who\nhaven't returned, isn't she."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_4_1,"The Royal Treasury... Even in such an unlikely place,\nwhere there's only valuable stuff, there's junkta be\nfound, I'll show ya!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_4_2,"With it being Lady Lushenda, I believe she would have\norganized the treasury and disposed of unnecessary\nitems, but... Best we not tell Duston that, okay."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_1,"Speaking of Sea Breeze Cave, in the False World, the\nlocation containing the secret passage to Gran Zedora\nCastle had the same name, did it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_2,"At that time, Crows abruptly appeared, however now I\nwonder where he is and what he is doing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_5_3,"Now that you mention it, we still don't know why he\nhelped us, do we."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_6_1,"Let's go to the Royal Treasury in Sea Breeze Cave.\nI'm worried about the soldiers who went to get the\nchemicals and haven't returned."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_30_6_2,"I hope nothing happened, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_1_1,"...How could Milt say something so coldhearted to\nAnlucia. As a friend, I feel terrible for her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_2_1,"Anlucia would never ditch {pc} and us!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_2_2,"Why does that Milt jerk look at Anlucia like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_3_1,"We definitely have to stop the Great Demon King's\nplan. Isn't that right, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_4_1,"I ain't worried about useless ring stealin' monsters!\nI'll protect my junk no matter what!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_5_1,"The Great Demon King's theft of the previous Hero's\nring; what sort of plan could he have for it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_5_2,"As Sage Lushenda said, although the demons possess\nit, it does not appear to serve their purposes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_6_1,"......."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_40_6_2,"{pc}... I want nothing more than for you\nto believe me. I will never run away like that again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_1_1,"We can't let the Great Demon King Madesagora go wild\nlike this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_1_2,"{pc}, let's totally take down the Great\nDemon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_2_1,"If we don't defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora\nbefore he takes over the world, everybody in this\nworld will be endangered."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_2_2,"...With all our own hands, we gotta protect this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_3_1,"I don't want this world we live in to be taken over\nby the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_3_2,"We absolutely must stop the Great Demon King's plan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_4_1,"The Great Demon King's tryin' to turn everythin' in\nthis world into junk, yeah?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_4_2,"If something like that happened, all the junk I\npainstakin'ly collected would be worth the same as\nanything else, wouldn't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_5_1,"Painting over the True World with a False World... I never\nthought he would do what he tried with Celed upon\nall of Lendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_5_2,"No, far from it, he may intend to paint over all of\nAstoltia. We must absolutely prevent that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_1,"As expected, the Great Demon King Madesagora was\ntrying to invade our world with his False World."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_2,"If such a thing were to happen, this world may be\nremade as the Great Demon King pleases."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_3,"It's not only this world's problem. The people living\nin the False World, we don't know what will happen\nto them, do we."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_4,"Raska and Chief Gash... I want to protect those people\ntoo. To do that, I need your help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_25_409_200_6_5,"Also, I'm curious about the Masked Man's existence.\nHaving the Hero's Ring, he must be plotting something..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_1_1,"Arold... Aro... Hehe. Doesn't really suit him, does it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_1,"That Shinon girl's pretty pushy about this Ryu guy,\nhuh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_2,"Crushing on him or not, using a dangerous thing like\na Hell File to make him sing... That ain't funny, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_2_3,"I get that she likes Ryu, but... Her violent manner's no\ngood, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_3_1,"Using a Hell File to force someone to sing like that;\nShinon's scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_4_1,"That client, Shinon's like me and can't help what she\nlikes; she's got a junkie smell!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_4_2,"I'm lookin' forward to how she'll use the Hell File\nwhen she gets it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_5_1,"She requests that we obtain the Hell File, however,\nwill she truly use it for good upon receiving it...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_5_2,"N... No, {pc} made the decision. I am\ncertain that it will be fine, however..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_6_1,"Seem we can obtain the Hell File at Coniware Plain,\nright."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_10_6_2,"...But how do you make someone sing with a file?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_1_1,"The Hell File... Neither the name nor the look of it make\nit seem like a tool that can make somebody sing, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_1_2,"Anyway, let's give it to Shinon. And if anything goes\ndown, we may have to save Ryu."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_2_1,"We got the Hell File, but... Is this Ryu guy safe?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_3_1,"We obtained the Hell File, but should we really give\nit to Shinon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_3_2,"She requested it, so we must transfer it to her,\nalthough... It is a tad bit concerning, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_4_1,"I'm lookin' forward to seein' what the client'll do\nwith the Hell File, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_5_1,"Uugh... How can such a serrated file make one sing..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_15_6_1,"I don't know much about it, but how is this file used\nin singing, I wonder?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_1_1,"Ryu the ryuuboku... For a name, it's definitely not outta\nplace, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_1_2,"But it sounds a person's name too, so that's why we\nwere mistaken."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_2_1,"Ryu the ryuuboku... I get it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_2_2,"Anyhow, I was relieved that it was not a person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_3_1,"I'm glad that Ryu was driftwood..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_4_1,"Gupupupu! The client's quite the oddball, ain't she!\nI've lost it too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_4_2,"Even as you are now, I think you haven't completely\nlost it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_5_1,"Conveying the proper information is important, is it\nnot... I, too, must take care to not be misinterpreted by\npeople as such..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_1,"An instrument-loving instrument maker... I don't think I\ncould be like her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_2,"I learned to play musical instruments when I was little.\nMy mother told me that it was a hobby of the Royal\nFamily's Princesses..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_3,"But, for me, it's like I had no talent. No matter how\nmuch I practiced, not only could I not play well,\ncomplaints always seemed to come in from somewhere..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_4,"Ever since, I don't like playing instruments. I love\nlistening to them though."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_372_200_6_5,"Ah. Sorry. Somehow, I got carried away talking about\nmyself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_1_1,"Dr. Rossum's research will not progress if the tablet remains stolen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_1_2,"Defeat Stoneman in Solaria Canyon and retrieve the\nSlate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_1,"I can't imagine that a monster would want a stone tablet...\nEven if the characters are difficult for humans to decipher,\nCan a monster read it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_2,"I can't deny that possibility.\nThere are probably monsters in this world who are more intelligent than us and have deeper knowledge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_2_3,"Intelligence and knowledge...\nFor some reason, it reminded me of the Garden of Learning."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_3_1,"The mystery of the lithograph...I'm really interested in it too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_3_2,"{pc}, let's defeat Stoneman and return the\nSlate to the Doctor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_4_1,"You're a monster with no sense\nfor stealing a stone tablet that is useful for research!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_4_2,"Is it a matter of taste...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_5_1,"Ancient history and culture are also precious treasures.\nLet's recover the stolen tablets."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_10_6_1,"I wonder what Stoneman is going to do with\ntaking the tablets?\nI hope he doesn't eat them..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_1_1,"We successfully retrieved the tablet.\nNow, let's go deliver it to Dr. Rossum."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_2_1,"It's a really old stone tablet.\nI have no idea what it says on it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_2_2,"I have no idea what it's worth, but...\nWell, it's important to that doctor.\nLet's deliver it to him quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_3_1,"Let's give the tablet back to the doctor.\nWhat is written on this tablet?\nI want Dr. Rossum to tell me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_4_1,"I'm not interested in precious stone tablets!\nI'll collect\nthe stones around there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_4_2,"Yes, yes, Mr. Duston.\nI'll collect the stones later,\nand I'll go give the tablet to Dr. Rossum."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_5_1,"This stone tablet is filled with\npast history and culture.\nWe have to cherish it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_20_6_1,"I'm glad you got the stone tablet back safely.\n...It hasn't been chewed on, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_1,"What if... if our travels were written on stone tablets and remained until the distant future, I wonder if someone would read them and study them..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_2,"It's a very romantic story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_1_3,"When I think about that, I get kind of nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_2_1,"All of Astortia is shaking\nGod's mystery..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_2_2,"It's so grand that I can't get enough of it.\nMy goal is to defeat the enemy in front of me,\nand protect the person I want to protect. I hope I can do that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_3_1,"I can't believe that the human god's\ngreat secret was written on that stone tablet...!\nI'm glad we were able to get it back from the monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_3_2,"You said that you would\ntell me a new story once the deciphering progresses.\nI'm looking forward to it, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_4_1,"Aww!!\nI'm so chilled that I helped you make such a valuable discovery!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_5_1,"Because of scholars like Dr. Rossum,\nwe can carve a new future\nbased on history."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_1,"...I see.The object of worship that was found in the ruins of\nOld God in Solaria Canyon was\nGran Zenis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_2,"By the way, there is also a book written about the god Gran Zenis in the library of Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_3,"According to that, the god Gran Zenis bestowed\nthe power of destroying demons and saving the world\non selected humans."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_4,"That's right... That's the beginning of being a hero.\nI don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the god Gran Zenis is the\norigin of the Kingdom of Gran Zedora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_410_200_6_5,"Yeah. It was a good opportunity for me to once again\nremember my mission as a hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_1_1,"If Gran Zedora's soldiers were to go around\nasking around in the Arahaghiro Kingdom,\nit would certainly become a big deal..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_1_2,"Let's cooperate with the investigation in Arahaghiro\nKingdom, so that Prince Toma's body can be found as\nsoon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_2_1,"We can't publicly say\nthat the prince's body is missing...\nWe should take action."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_3_1,"We have to\nsecretly search for the prince's body so as not to worry other countries."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_1,"Stealing valuable things and selling them off are boring people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_2,"Huh... Even old men sometimes say\ntrivial things.\nI agree. Stealing is boring, isn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_3,"Absolutely.\nIf you want to steal my precious junk like Chiri, I understand!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_4_4,"...Ah, that's right.\nI guess you're a little off.\nThis old man..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_5_1,"Did the culprit go to Arahaghiro Kingdom to sell the\nstolen goods after opening up Prince Toma's grave?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_5_2,"First of all, I think it would be a good idea to go to Arahaghiro Castle and talk to a person named Darash who is in charge of\ncrime control."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_6_1,"{pc}. Thank you for accepting the\nrequest from Captain Nogato."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_10_6_2,"Please lend me your power so that Big Brother Toma can rest in peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_1_1,"Mr. Darash and the others can't catch\ngrave robbers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_1_2,"It's like stealing from the royal tombs.\nI'm sure they're all good at it.\nDon't let your guard down..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_2_1,"Desert Earth Dragon... That's a pretty good name.\nHe's going out of his way to steal treasure from the royal tombs.\nHe must be some bastard."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_1,"They're a group of grave robbers who are quick on the run and are inciting monsters...\nThey seem formidable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_2,"But it's for the Queen and Anlucia.\nYou can't say something weak!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_3_3,"Thank you, Fuura."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_4_1,"Desert Earth Dragon...\nI don't know if it's strong or weak\nIt smells like a lump!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_5_1,"It's\ntroubling that they won't cooperate with us in catching the grave robbers, but\nit might actually be convenient for us to proceed with the investigation in secret."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_6_1,"The Desert Earth Dragon...\nThat's the group of grave robbers that stole Big Brother Toma's body."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_20_6_2,"I'll definitely catch it...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_1,"If we're to believe what the bandits said\nearlier, Prince Toma's body may have been\nstolen by someone else somehow..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_2,"But the royal tomb is supposed to be\ninaccessible, except to members of the\nroyal family..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_1_3,"Hmm... Anyways, reporting this to Captain\nNogato sounds good, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_1,"That Darash guy had some awfully good\ntiming to show up when he did..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_2,"He didn't plan for us to catch those\nDesert Mole guys, instead of doing it\nthemselves, did he...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_2_3,"What do you think... Guess we'll never know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_3_1,"To break into a grave and do something like\nsteal what's in the coffin, it's disgusting!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_4_1,"I knew they were a bunch of useless thieves.\nI kind of like them!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_1,"Mr. Darash seemed to be concerned about us\nand came running to see us, didn't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_2,"When we spoke to him in Al-Ahagiro Kingdom,\nI honestly had the impression that he was\nnot a serious person...\n<br>\nPerhaps, he is a better person than I had\nthought."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_5_3,"I suppose, working for King Moonis, he\nwould have to be a good man. I must learn\nto be a better judge of character."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_6_1,"By the time the Desert Moles showed up,\nsomeone had already stolen Big Brother\nToma's body...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_30_6_2,"Somehow, I think it will be difficult to\nget any more information here. Let's go\nback and report to Captain Nogato."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_1_1,"I hope this investigation will make some progress..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_1_2,"If we don't find Prince Toma's body soon,\nPrincess Anlucia and the Queen will continue to suffer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_2_1,"Did the grave robbers tell the truth?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_2_2,"What is the culprit going to do after stealing the prince's body\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_3_1,"I'm glad that the culprit who stole the prince's burial goods was found, but...\nThe body was never found..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_4_1,"Even I have no idea what\nthe guy who steals a dead body feels."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_5_1,"Aside from the ornaments, why did the real culprit steal\nPrince Toma's body...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_1,"If you leave the matter about the grave robbers to Captain Nogato, you'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_2,"It's me.\nThat person once helped me when I went to subjugate a monster.\nThat time, I seriously injured him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_3,"But he laughed it off and comforted me, saying\nMy medal has increased by one more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_436_200_6_4,"I may look like a scary person, but\nI'm actually a very kind person.\nI think that's why I was chosen to be a soldier commander."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_1_1,"If you have a bad back, it can't be helped that you can't go to a hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_1_2,"Let's take\nYunohana to the old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_2_1,"Yakupu, the old man\nmust have really liked hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_2_2,"It's\nhard not being able to freely go anywhere you like... Let's quickly pick up some branches and shells and\nbring Yunohana from the hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_3_1,"When I heard Mr. Yakup's story\n... it seems like it was a pretty open hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_4_1,"I'll leave it to you\nto look for treasure shells and other beautiful things, and I'll\nlook for junk like usual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_5_1,"I don't think there was a place called Montserro Hot Springs Gorge in the fake world, but...\nIs there a reason?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_5_2,"Come on.\nI guess the Great Demon King hates Flo?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_10_6_1,"It seems that the hot springs are good for healing injuries, but\nI don't think I can go because my back hurts.\nI feel bad for Yakup as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_1_1,"I'd like to exchange white plum branches and pale pink treasure shells for yunohana...\nMaybe it's a bit romantic."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_2_1,"I got the branches and shells.\nLet's go to the hot spring manager!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_3_1,"It's a pity that Mr. Yakupu himself couldn't bring the white plum branch and\npale red treasure shell to exchange\nwith Yunohana..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_4_1,"...It's a hot spring.\nEven if it's not as strong as the ocean, it's unsettling to be surrounded by a large amount of\nwater."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_5_1,"In exchange for Yunohana, you received a branch of white plum blossoms and a pale red jewel shell\n.I guess the hot spring manager likes beautiful things..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_20_6_1,"It's kind of wonderful to bring\nbeautiful shells and scented branches from the seaside as souvenirs to the hot spring gorge in the mountains."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_1_1,"I want to go to the hot springs, but\nMr. Yakupu is waiting for me.\nLet's deliver Yunohana right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_2_1,"A hot spring, huh?\nYou should go to the hot springs to relieve the fatigue of your journey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_2_2,"It looks really comfortable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_3_1,"It's nice...hot springs.\nI want to soak in it, even if it's just for my feet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_4_1,"It's called Yunohana, so\nI was wondering what kind of flower it was, but\nIsn't it a powder with a strange smell?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_4_2,"I kinda liked it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_5_1,"I'm glad that there doesn't seem to be any\nabnormality happening at Montserro Hot Springs Gorge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_6_1,"Once you've finished everything you need to do,\nit would be nice to relax in a hot spring."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_30_6_2,"When I go to the hot springs, I want to invite my father and\nmother as well.\nOf course, {pc} too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_1,"Hehe. After all, the two of you\nhave been thinking about each other for a long time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_2,"Don't talk about gals\nWouldn't it be better to stab the old man with a nail?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_1_3,"If I was thinking about Rugina that much,\nI don't think I would talk about other girls..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_2_1,"Yakub's old man, I hope you can heal your back quickly and meet\nRugina's grandmother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_3_1,"If you like Rugina, wouldn't it be better to talk about sexy gals in moderation?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_4_1,"It's scary how Yunohana can make a weak old person healthy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_4_2,"I don't think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_5_1,"Yakub will also be able to\nreunite with Rugina someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_5_2,"I hope you two stay healthy for longer than the time we spent thinking about each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_438_200_6_1,"I'm glad Yakup is doing well.\nNo matter how old you are, your feelings for others are important."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_1_1,"I feel a little uncomfortable\ninvestigating other people's backgrounds..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_1_2,"{pc}, let's listen to the story quickly and\nwithout attracting too much attention."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_1,"I'm sure there are\nthings in the past that you don't want anyone to know about..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_2,"Hey {pc}!\nI have a request to investigate a guy named Zodera...\nIf you accept it, I'll help you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_2_3,"I don't really care about it.\n...and that priest named Juaro\ndoesn't really bother me either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_3_1,"I understand Juaro's point, but\nI think it's not a good idea to secretly investigate the other party."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_3_2,"I feel confused somehow..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_1,"That priest named Juaro\nLooks like a fool and I hate him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_2,"This time, I agree with the old man.\nI don't want a guy who looks like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_3,"Hmm? Hyuza... It seems that you have finally awakened to\nyour path as my comrade! You are most welcome!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_4_4,"No, I don't know about the Ponkotsu road!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_1,"I understand why the person who becomes the high priest of the Alltrades Abbey should be\nclean and innocent, but\nI don't feel very good about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_2,"But what kind of person is Mr. Zodera?\nI don't think listening to the stories of everyone at the Alltrades Abbey is a bad thing in itself."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_5_3,"Even if a bad rumor comes out...\nIt is an important responsibility of those in higher positions\nto know about it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_6_1,"Mr. Juaro spoke in a bit of a prickly way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_10_6_2,"If there are no problems after questioning,\nI'm sure you'll agree."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_1_1,"It's a bit unnatural for a priest who is passionate about his training to go to a bar...\nIt might just be a chance to take a breather, but\nIt's a bit unnatural to be with someone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_2_1,"Did you get to hear the story?\n...Priests called Zodera don't seem to want to get involved with other people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_3_1,"I heard a lot of stories from everyone at the temple.\n...Mr. Zodera is very strict.\nIt feels a little scary."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_4_1,"Is that priest named Zodera a drinker with whom you have a bad relationship?\nI think it's good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_5_1,"Based on what I heard\n, I can't say anything yet..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_20_6_1,"The results of the investigation are not clear.\nIn any case, let's tell Mr. Juaro\nwhat we heard."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_1_1,"...It's not good for you to secretly investigate people behind their backs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_1_2,"But\nit's not good for you to throw away something you've already accepted.\nLet's go to the bar in Ceredo!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_2_1,"...I don't really feel like it, but\nI've already accepted all the requests.\nSince I've been asked to do it, I have no choice but to do it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_3_1,"Now I have to\nfollow Mr. Zodera..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_3_2,"Background checks can be daunting."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_4_1,"Sounds interesting!\nLet's go to the bar in Ceredo and find out if a priest called Zodera is a weirdo or not!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_5_1,"Ugh. You're the kind of person who searches for people like this...\nBut when you turn down a request once you've accepted it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_30_6_1,"...I guess that's what's going to happen.\nI'm also concerned that things remain unclear.\nIf this happens, let's keep in touch."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_1_1,"Mr. Zodera...\nsaid something quite disturbing at the bar, but\nI couldn't catch the important part."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_1_2,"Let's go report to Mr. Juaro what we heard earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_1,"...Didn't that guy Zodera say something pretty\nweird?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_2,"I couldn't hear who he was talking about, but\nhe said, I was the one who killed him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_2_3,"I don't want to believe it, but\nI think it might happen."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_3_1,"What Zodera was saying\nI couldn't hear it very well, but\nyou were talking dangerously..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_4_1,"I like weirdos, but\nI'm not interested in murdering people!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_5_1,"It wasn't like he was joking, and\nI don't think it's very easy to kill him..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_40_6_1,"That person named Zodera\nI feel like I've seen her somewhere...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_1_1,"If you have a history of giving up on\npeople who might become the next high priest,\nthat's a big problem..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_1_2,"I think I understand\nMr. Juaro's feelings of hurry."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_2_1,"A witness...\nI wonder if the High Priest Sama will believe what we saw?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_3_1,"Zodera...\nI wonder if you really gave up on people in the past..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_4_1,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\nI have no interest in killing people, so please finish this request quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_5_1,"The story has turned into a big deal.\nBut if it's true that you abandoned someone,\nwe can't just ignore it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_6_1,"......."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_50_6_2,"Ah. Sorry {pc}.\nI was just thinking.\nShall we go to the High Priest?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_1_1,"In the first place, our story alone is not enough to convince the\nHigh Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_1_2,"I just overheard\nZodera talking about something disturbing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_2_1,"I understand Juaro's point, but\nGrand Priest Sama is too supportive of Zodera.\n...Is it just my imagination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_3_1,"Isn't it better to believe in the words of the High Priest and not pursue Mr. Zodera too deeply?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_4_1,"Come on! Let's accept\nthanks from a priest named Juaro and move on!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_4_2,"I'd be happy if I could get some junk, but\nI can't expect much."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_5_1,"The high priest probably has something in mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_60_6_1,"That's what the high priest said\nI'm sure it'll be fine.\nI also feel like I can trust Zodera."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_1_1,"Juaro doesn't seem to agree, but\nI think it's better to leave it to the High Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_2_1,"If Zodera was a bad person,\nGrand Priest Sama wouldn't be on our side..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_2_2,"Mr. Zodera is a scary person, but\nhe's probably not a bad person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_3_1,"The High Priest may know Mr. Juaro and\nMr. Zodera that we don't know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_3_2,"I guess that's why I trust Zodera."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_4_1,"By the way, there was a traveling entertainer troupe in the courtyard.\nThey might have some nice junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_5_1,"Juaro seems to be remorseful as well, so\nI guess he was really worried about the future of the Alltrades Abbey and asked us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_6_1,"Hey {pc}. Would you like to talk to\nthe dancer of the traveling entertainer troupe in the temple courtyard?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_439_200_6_2,"My friend Janna was also\na dancer in a traveling entertainer troupe, so I was interested in her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_1_1,"If you make a wish on a bud and when the flower blooms,\nyour dream will come true. How romantic!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_2_1,"In order for Reedy's wish to come true,\nlet's take her to the Hill of Hope in the Rhône Forest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_3_1,"Make a wish on the bud of the flower of hope...\nCan I try it too, {pc}?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_4_1,"You can get all the junk in the world just by making a wish on a flower!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_4_2,"If it's all a lie that dreams come true\nWell then, that's a lot of crap!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_5_1,"A flower that makes dreams come true...\nWhat a wonderful story."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_6_1,"...{pc}.\nLet's go to\nthe hill where the flower of hope blooms in the Rhone forest belt."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_10_6_2,"So that Mr. Lidi can make a wish to\nthe Flower of Hope..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_1_1,"Even though Mr. Reedy is motivated,\nI don't have to say anything to push him away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_1_2,"I guess Mr. Zodera doesn't want to interact with anyone\nafter all?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_2_1,"Reedy guy...\nEven if Zodera says something unpleasant\nI hope you don't get discouraged and do your best."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_3_1,"I can't forgive you for saying something negative to Mr. Lidi who is trying his best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_4_1,"That dancer named Lidi\nis incredibly positive, isn't she?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_4_2,"Even if you're not good at it at first,\nyou'll work hard and get better at it, so\njust look at it, it's not my thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_5_1,"Is it because Mr. Zodera was cold towards Mr. Lidi because he thought you were immature?\nI don't think so..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_1,"Lidi admired Janna and became\na dancer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_2,"Janna was a dancer who was so thrilling to watch\nand did such wonderful dances, but\nshe's already passed away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_20_6_3,"But I also didn't know that the Shitar troupe that Janna was in became\nthe Gizanto troupe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_1_1,"After losing Janna, I wonder if\nI have lost sight of the meaning of my job as chairperson."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_2_1,"That stubby-looking man\nwas originally the chairman of a traveling entertainer troupe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_2_2,"The fact that you didn't respond to\nthe old man from Gizant's persuasion means that Janna feels responsible for\nthe dancer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_3_1,"I wonder if Zodera is devoting herself to her training because she feels guilty for\nlosing Janna..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_3_2,"If that's the case, perhaps Zodera has too much sense of responsibility..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_4_1,"Not only do you want to drink it, but you're a serious priest!\nI'm totally disappointed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_4_2,"I want you to emulate my Junkie a little!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_5_1,"The reason I heard you say killed at the bar before was because\nMr. Zodera felt that much responsible for\nMr. Janna's death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_5_2,"Is this what the High Priest said there was nothing to worry about?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_6_1,"Mr. Zodera is the chairman of the Shital troupe...\nI felt like I had seen him somewhere before, but I guess that's what happened after all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_440_200_6_2,"...I can't believe he felt so responsible for Janna's death that he quit the\ntroupe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_1_1,"The fact that the High Priest is asking us for\ncooperation may be\na big problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_1_2,"Let's hear from Mr. Gizanto."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_2_1,"Hey, hey...\nAre you in trouble before the appointment ceremony...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_3_1,"What is the troupe's problem...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_3_2,"{pc}, if we can do anything\n, let's help!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_4_1,"So, you just agreed to help someone?\nAs a thank you, this time I'll get\nsome junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_5_1,"In the basement of the Alltrades Abbey,\noffer prayers for peace in this world...\nThe high priest had such a role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_5_2,"Is it like Azlan's wind ceremony?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_10_6_1,"{pc}.\nI will also ask you to do so.\nLet's solve the problem of the Gizanto troupe together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_1_1,"If the costumes don't arrive,\nReedy won't be able to dance!\nLet's hurry to the village!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_2_1,"Wow, it's such a fuss that the costumes haven't arrived yet.\nWell, let's go find them quickly.\nIt's a village between Ceredo and Arahaghiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_1,"I totally understand why Reedi is so particular about costumes.Because with costumes, you can bear everyone's expectations and feelings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_2,"When I wore the Kaze no Koromo at the Kazeokuri no Ceremony,\nI felt that everyone\ngave me power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_3_3,"{pc}. Let's go find\nan outfit for Reedy so she can\ndance for everyone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_4_1,"There's no junk in Alltrades Abbey, so\nI'd be happy to accompany you\non your way to Arahaghiro, looking for junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_5_1,"Mr. Reedy was\nenthusiastic about making Mr. Zodera have fun...\nI want to make sure he is fully prepared so that he can dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_6_1,"Dancers' costumes are like weapons for us, so it can't be helped that Mr. Reedi is concerned about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_20_6_2,"Speaking of a village between Arahaghiro and\nAlltrades Abbey...\nIs it near the waterfall in the Llana Desolation Area?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_1_1,"I can't believe you stole my precious costume!\nLet's quickly get it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_2_1,"I didn't know that the delivery man was attacked by monsters.\nIf that's the case, then we should have come.\nIt was the right thing to do."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_2_2,"{pc}!\nHurry up and get\nReedy's outfit back from Star Lemming!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_3_1,"We will absolutely get back\nReedy's precious costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_4_1,"Stealing a dancer's costume\nYou're a monster that stinks!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_5_1,"If we hadn't come,\nwe almost wouldn't have received the costume.\nNow, let's find the monster that stole the costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_30_6_1,"The one who stole the costume was Star Lemming!\nIf you hurry, he should still have it with him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_1_1,"I have to hurry and deliver the precious costume!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_2_1,"You managed to get the dancer's costume back.\nOkay, let's get the costume quickly.\nReedy and the others are waiting!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_3_1,"If we don't quickly deliver the costume to Mr. Reedy,\nMr. Reedy's turn will begin!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_4_1,"It's not that easy to find nice junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_4_2,"Hmm? Did you find what you were looking for?\nIf you want to deliver it, I'll go right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_5_1,"I'm glad your costume hasn't been bitten.\nLet's go back to the Alltrades Abbey before Mr. Lidi's turn comes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_40_6_1,"I'm glad you got your costume back!\nNow all you have to do is deliver it to Mr. Lidi.\nLet's hurry back to the Alltrades Abbey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_1_1,"Standing on stage\ndancing in the same costume as the person you admire...isn't it wonderful?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_2_1,"I managed to deliver the costume in time.I'm relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_2_2,"Then let's enjoy Lidi's dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_3_1,"That's Lidi's dance...\nI'm sure it's really beautiful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_4_1,"I'm going to the temple courtyard!\nSince you asked me to come watch the dance,\nI can't even look for junk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_5_1,"I completely understand how you want to get closer to the person you admire."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_5_2,"When I become king someday, I will be like your father."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_6_1,"I see...that costume belongs to Janna...\nMr. Lidi respects Janna so much..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_45_6_2,"If Janna was alive\nI'm sure she would be happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_1_1,"Reedi's dance\nwas so amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_1_2,"I want to see you again somewhere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_2_1,"I can't believe that Zodera old man\nis encouraging Lidi over there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_2_2,"...Heh, there are some good things about it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_3_1,"Reedi's dance...\nI was really nervous when I fell down, but\nI'm glad I was able to dance till the end!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_3_2,"Thanks to the old man from Zodera."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_4_1,"That dancer named Lidi is well-suited to becoming popular.\nI don't think she has any connection with me, who likes to play."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_1,"Mr. {pc}....\nI'm really impressed right now!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_2,"As the high priest said,\nI felt as if my soul had been shaken by Reedy's dance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_5_3,"Yes.\nJanna's dancing was also very nice, but\nit was just as good."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_1,"Those words from Mr. Zodera...\nThe performance ends when the audience applauds."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_2,"...My journey as a hero will end when\nI defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora\nand the people can live in peace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_50_6_3,"I can't afford to lose to Lidi!\nSo {pc}\nI look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_1,"Reedy's dance\nmoved the hearts of others\nIt was amazing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_2,"Yes, I think dancers and traveling entertainers are\namazing. Their performances can brighten people's hearts\nand energize them."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_1_3,"I also respect people like them who use their honed skills to cheer up your soul.\n...Uncle Nablett, I hope you're doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_2_1,"The old man from Zodera... no, Chairman Shital.\nThe way he encouraged Reedy during the entertainment\nHe certainly looked like the chairman of a troupe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_2_2,"I ended up going back to the troupe instead of the High Priest Sama, but...I think it was a good thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_3_1,"If Mr. Shital returns to the chair,\nMr. Lidi will become a great dancer!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_3_2,"Ah, that's right.\nI'm sure you'll build a good teacher-pupil relationship."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_1,"The Alltrades Abbey is not my cup of tea after all, with no junk or junk.\nPlease call me when it becomes a ruin."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_2,"I wonder if Mr. Duston\nwill be alive by then...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_3,"Well, even Mr. Duston\nwouldn't it be difficult...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_4,"No... I'm talking about an old man, so\nI don't understand."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_4_5,"Uh, {pc}...\nMr. Duston, isn't everyone treating you strangely...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_1,"It was all prepared by the high priest...\nAs expected of someone who protects the Alltrades Abbey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_2,"Raguas will become a worthy\nking, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_5_3,"Of course.\nTo that end, I have to learn more\non this journey!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_1,"Janna's death was not\nShital's fault.\nI'm glad you returned to the chair."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_2,"I'm sure Lidi will bring smiles to the faces of\nas many people as Janna."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_441_200_6_3,"When we defeat the Great Demon King and peace is achieved,\nI would like to ask him to perform at Gran Zedora Castle again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_1_1,"It's my work tool, so\nI would probably notice\nthat I forgot my bag, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_2_1,"I'll pick up the\ntool bag at the ship management station south of Rendoa, then deliver it to the engineer at\nRagi Snowfield... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_2_2,"...It's a pain, but\nThat engineer must be in trouble too.\nLet's go to the ship management office first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_3_1,"I guess you can\ndeliver the tool bag that the engineer forgot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_4_1,"If you're an engineer, you probably have one or two pieces of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_5_1,"The Grand Titus\nto the Kingdom of Gran Zedora\nseems to be going smoothly, which is great."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_5_2,"If Captain Abram is interested in this request,\nI would also like to cooperate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_10_6_1,"Captain Abram seemed to be quite concerned about\nconsidering it was just something he forgot...\nDid something happen?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_1,"In order to receive the tool bag,\nI need to find a high-tech spanner.\nA ghoul in the west of Guren territory... huh?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_2,"I have visited the western part of Guren territory several times\nwith Arold. I think there were many strong monsters in the area where there were ghouls."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_1_3,"However, this was before we traveled together with {pc} and the others...\nIt shouldn't be too difficult for us now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_2_1,"You won't be able to do your job with a broken spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_2_2,"'Let's go get some high-tech spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_3_1,"{pc}!\nLet's go get you\na high-tech spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_4_1,"You didn't do the work I was asked to do and forced you to\non me...\nThat's a lot of crap!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_1,"Why does a ghoul have a high-tech spanner\n...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_2,"Come on. You'll pick up anything that falls, like Duston's old man\n, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_3,"I don't pick up anything!\nJust useless junk!\nDon't underestimate me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_5_4,"It seems like..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_6_1,"It's a problem for the station staff as well.\nWe thought it was a boarding ship.\nLet's get the high-tech wrench too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_20_6_2,"I believe\nghouls sometimes drop high-tech spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_1_1,"Let's take the high-tech spanner to\nMr. Yakkoi."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_2_1,"With this high-tech wrench,\ntechnicians will have no trouble doing maintenance work."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_3_1,"It seems like a high-tech spanner will\nwork faster than a regular spanner."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_4_1,"A useful spanner for free\nis high-tech and shiny...\nIt's the worst!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_5_1,"I see...\nThere are many different types of spanners."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_30_6_1,"Now all you have to do is pick up your tool bag at the ship control station and deliver it to the\nengineer."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_1_1,"Regardless of the reason, we're still friends\nso it's better to make up before we get stuck."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_1_2,"...before the relationship gets strained and we end up hurting each other."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_2_1,"For what reason did the captain and the engineer, who were polite adults, fight?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_2_2,"I heard that Engineer Pageo and Captain Abram have been friends for decades.\nI hope their relationship doesn't deteriorate like this..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_3_1,"I'm trying to have the tool bag delivered to Mr. Bajeo."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_3_2,"The captain is also aware that things can't go on like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_4_1,"If you were to replace it with a high-tech spanner,\nyou wouldn't hand over your broken spanner to me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_5_1,"It's a nice gesture to\nreplace a broken wrench when delivering something you forgot to someone you had a fight with."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_40_6_1,"I thought Captain Abram was\na calm person, but\nhe gets into big fights..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_1_1,"Both the captain and Mr. Pageo\nare clumsy people who can't express their feelings in words."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_1_2,"...Hehe, I remembered\nArold and Giganf."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_2_1,"Kindness is something you do\nwithout even realizing it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_2_2,"I think it would have been good if\nthe old man from Pageo realized that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_3_1,"I guess Mr. Bajeo and the captain had different feelings and got into a fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_3_2,"It's hard to be friends when trying to please someone\nends up in a fight...\nIt's hard to be friends."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_4_1,"The best thing about tools is that they are bare!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_5_1,"I thought the exchange of spanners was a courtesy, but\nit turned out to be a message from the captain.\nFriendship is difficult..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_50_6_1,"I'm really glad that we were able to reconcile the two of you with our help.\nAll that's left now is to report to Captain Abram."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_1_1,"I'm relieved that the captain and Mr. Pageo were able to make up."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_1_2,"It's definitely not good for things to go on like that... relations are strained."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_2_1,"It's so troublesome, the old men's fight has finally settled down."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_2_2,"Friendships that have been nurtured over a long period of time are not easily broken."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_3_1,"I'm glad that the captain and Bajeo were able to make up\nMr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_1,"It's your fault that the new device is better!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_2,"But thanks to that, we were able to go to\nLendersia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_4_3,"Pugy!\nI'll put up with it for Lendersia's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_5_1,"Thinking about things from a broader perspective...\nEven if you think you understand it, it's difficult."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_1,"I'm glad I was able to help Captain Abram.\nI used to be indebted to the captain."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_2,"When I was little, I didn't like ships...\nI didn't even want to go on the Grand Titus.\nI complained a lot."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_3,"But when the captain heard\nhe stayed by my side the whole time...\nHe told me fun stories about the sea until we arrived at the port."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_4,"Since then, I feel comfortable going on the ship.\nI am still very grateful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_442_200_6_5,"Someday, if I have a chance, I will tell you the sea story that the captain told me.\nIt was a really fun story!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_1,"When you admire someone you like, it feels like\nI don't really understand, but\nI admire you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_2,"Lord Arold.......\nLord Arro......."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_1_3,"No, I'm a little embarrassed!\nNow, let's quickly collect the toad oil and\nbones of the ancient dragon to make the flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_2_1,"Is it Kuro this time...\nIsn't it Kuro from Clover?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_2_2,"I can't help but doubt it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_3_1,"I want to support Sinon's love.\nLet's do everything we can!\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_4_1,"I'm not interested in things like love, but\nYou're a lot more polished than last time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_5_1,"Kuro...?\nI'm a little concerned, but\nLet's prioritize gathering materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_10_6_1,"I'm a little jealous.\nI wonder what it feels like to make an effort for the person you love."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_1_1,"Now, Sinon will be able to make\na flute for Kuro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_1_2,"I don't know what kind of flute it will be made from the oil of the cattail and the bones of the ancient dragon\n, but...\nI'm sure Kuro will like it too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_2_1,"I'll take the toad oil and the bones of the ancient dragon and return to\nSinon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_2_2,"What kind of guy is\nasking me to make a flute out of something like this...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_3_1,"I wonder what kind of flute Mr. Sinon is planning to make with the oil of the cattail and the bones of the ancient dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_3_2,"It's hard to imagine just looking at the materials."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_4_1,"I'd rather have the fish bones\nafter they've eaten than the precious bones of ancient dragons!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_5_1,"If you make a flute with these bones,\nwhat kind of sound will it make?\nI'm a little curious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_20_6_1,"The only thing left to do is deliver\nthe materials for the flute to Sinon, the maiden in love.\nGama's oil... Did you have it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_1_1,"I'm sure Sinon can make\na wonderful flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_1_2,"I hope you can convey your feelings to Kuro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_2_1,"...Sinon can only see Kuro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_3_1,"Sinon, you really love Kuro.I hope Kuro will like the flute that Sinon made."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_4_1,"Even if I make it according to the instructions, the whistle doesn't make a proper sound!\nThat guy named Kuro\ndoes a pretty good job."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_5_1,"The Pendulum of Fate has\npower again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_5_2,"Is there any connection between Sinon's love and our fate?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_6_1,"I hope Kuro will be happy with the flute that Sinon makes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_30_446_200_6_2,"Anyway, Kuro is a name I heard somewhere."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_1_1,"By helping those in need,\nI was able to gather the power of destiny, so\nI was able to kill two birds with one stone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_1_2,"Killing three birds with one stone by exterminating monsters and strengthening your body?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_2_1,"Delivering a hot spring souvenir to an old man\nCleaning up after a fight between older adults...\nWill something like this change fate?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_2_2,"If it helped someone\nthat's fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_3_1,"...Reedy's dance was beautiful.\nI want to see it again. Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_3_2,"For that reason, we must use the power of the Pendulum of Fate to stop the Great Demon King's plan!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_1,"Even though I was just helping them make strange musical instruments,\nthe power of destiny came together..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_2,"As expected, the former Junkie 2 is destined to summon the ponkotsu!\nThere was no madness in my eyes!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_4_3,"...Since the old man is following me,\nI can't say it was a mistake."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_5_1,"Compared to the time I visited the True World's Melsandy Cered\nArahaghiro,\nthere were no major incidents."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_5_2,"Even if each event is small,\nthe accumulation of them may change\na huge flow that can be called destiny."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_0_6_1,"Looks like the Pendulum of Fate is full of power again.\nLet's go back to report to Lady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_1_1,"Hurry up and chase Anlucia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_1_2,"Mr. Anlucia's face looks demonic....\nIt's dangerous to let her go like that...\nLet's hurry to Solaria Canyon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_2_1,"Anlucia guy, don't think about the future\nDon't jump out!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_2_2,"Quickly, let's chase down\nAnlucia to Solaria Canyon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_3_1,"We have to stop Anlucia!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_3_2,"Let's go to Solaria Canyon! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_4_1,"I can't believe you left without thinking\nThere's more to see than I expected!\nI'm going too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_5_1,"Astortia's hope is to be a hero...\nNo, even if she is not a hero\nPrincess Anlucia is our friend!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_10_5_2,"We can't afford to lose you,\n{pc}! Hurry!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_1_1,"I hope you go back to your usual Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_1_2,"It's dangerous to leave you alone.\nLet's follow!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_2_1,"That Milt guy...\nHe seemed to hate Anlucia, but\nHe protected her from monster attacks."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_2_2,"What's wrong with my friend...\nWhat happened?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_3_1,"I think Lady Anlucia is preoccupied with\nthe prince's Kataki...\nThat's why we have to support her!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_4_1,"Not once, but twice!\nWell, I can't lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_1,"What exactly is that technique that {pc} used to protect\nPrincess Anlucia?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_2,"...I see.\n{pc} doesn't really understand either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_20_5_3,"It seems that Lushenda has noticed what that is\n, but...\nRight now, we should go after Princess Anlucia first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_1_1,"Mr. Anlucia...\nWhen you found out that your brother was the masked man,\nyou must have been very shocked..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_2_1,"The masked man's true identity is\nAnlucia's big brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_2_2,"Even though I know we are the enemy,\nI feel heavy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_3_1,"The reunion between Princess Anlucia and Prince Tomas will be\npainful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_3_2,"My breasts are hurting too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_4_1,"I can't forgive you for trying to use a dead person as a tool!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_5_1,"To resurrect Prince Toma and use him to manipulate\nand invade the world..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_30_5_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle to think of countermeasures\nand meet up with Princess Anlucia and the others!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_1_1,"If {pc} is an ally of the hero,\nI would like you to train me, even though I am still lacking in ability."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_2_1,"{pc} is an ally of the hero...\nYou have taken on a very important role."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_3_1,"The hero's ally,\n{pc}, was\nan amazing person after all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_1,"I can't believe that you, the former Junkie 2, were anything but an ally of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_2,"Even though you look so absent-minded,\nI missed you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_4_3,"However, if I stay with you,\nI'm sure I'll meet some crap and crap, so\nI have no choice but to follow you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_1,"{pc} is an ally of the hero...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_2,"Not only the technique that protected Princess Anlucia\n, but also the encounter with us, the battle with Hades Nergel\n, and the fact that he has helped many people..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_5_3,"All of them are the guides of fate to fight against the Great Demon King Madesagora as allies of the hero\n...If you think about it that way, it makes sense."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_1,".......{pc}.\nI'll only confide in you, but it's me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_2,"When I found out that the masked man was Big Brother Toma, I was really happy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_3,"That's not Big Brother Toma anymore.\nI understand. But..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_4,"...I'm sorry. I found out that the Great Demon King's target was\nDivine Crimsonite.\nI have to be strong..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_437_200_6_5,"'Thank you {pc}.\nI'm glad I talked to you.\nI'm fine now."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_1_1,"The same mirror may be stored in the treasure vault of Arahaghiro Castle in the False World."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_1_2,"Isn't it worth\nto go?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_1,"King Sama is as careless as ever.\nI'm concerned about the Divine Crimsonite, but\nWith the way things are going, I feel like I have no choice but to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_2,"But a shattered mirror cannot be repaired."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_2_3,"For now, why don't you go to the fake Arahaghiro Castle?\nYou might find something similar."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_3_1,"King Moonis is so clumsy that even I get worried sometimes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_4_1,"That means you can't use the broken mirror anymore, right?\nI'll take it back!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_5_1,"It seems that the Arahaghiro Kingdom is in\nfinancial trouble due to the war, so\nKing Moonis must have been in a panic."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_5_2,"As a prince,\nI cannot leave the suffering people of other countries alone.\nLet's go find the mirror of the phantom sun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_6_1,"I wanted to ask if King Moonis knows anything about the Divine Crimsonite."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_10_6_2,"But I wonder if there is a replacement for the special mirror\nkept in the treasure vault of the Arahaghiro Kingdom...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_1_1,"Looks like a Grim Rider took the mirror away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_1_2,"Fortunately, the mirror I got back said\nthat I can do whatever I want with it, so let's go find the Grim Rider."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_1,"It's good to know that the mirror that King Moonis broke is\nin the False World of Arahaghiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_2,"I can't believe a monster took it away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_2_3,"Looks like we have no choice but to look for\nthe Grim Rider that the treasure room keeper told us about."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_3_1,"The same mirror existed in the False World of Arahaghiro too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_3_2,"If we recover it from the monsters and give it to you,\nKing Moonis will feel at ease!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_4_1,"Does that mean that the treasure in the treasury has become\njunk because no one needs it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_4_2,"Hmm...but it's a treasure, so someone might want\nsomeday... I'm at a loss as to whether or not to get it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_5_1,"The kingdom of Arahaghiro in the fake world was ruled by\nBermud, so it can't be helped that the country would be in chaos after his death."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_5_2,"I wonder if the people guarding the treasure house were also tired due to the domestic turmoil..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_6_1,"I have mixed feelings about the fact that the False World created by the Great Demon King can help save the people of the True World."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_20_6_2,"Anyway, we have to recover the Phantom Sun Mirror\nfrom the Grim Rider in the False World's Arahaghiro\nRegion."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_1_1,"I was saved because there was a mirror like\nin the False World of Arahaghiro."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_1_2,"If this mirror is unbroken,\nwe might be able to enter the Stone Chamber of the Sun."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_2_1,"I need to take\nto King Moonis quickly."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_2_2,"Aren't you crying by now because the minister is pestering you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_3_1,"{pc}!\nLet's deliver the mirror to King Moonis!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_4_1,"If I bring you a mirror, will you give me\nsome junk in return?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_5_1,"I'm glad we found the same thing as the broken mirror.\nThis is a problem that affects many people living in the Kingdom of Arahaghiro in the True World."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_6_1,"Will I be able to use the mirror of this False World to put\ninto the True World's hidden treasure?\nI tried to retrieve it, but I'm a little worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_30_6_2,"I think\nthe Divine Crimsonite may be in the Sun's Stone Chamber where the treasure is hidden."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_1_1,"I think {pc} would be able to\ndance without being shy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_2_1,"Is there a mechanism in the pyramid that reacts to dancing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_2_2,"{pc} Can't you dance properly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_3_1,"{pc}'s dance...\nI might really want to see it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_4_1,"Is this a pyramid where treasure is hidden?\nI'm not interested in ordinary treasures, but\nOld junk is most welcome!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_5_1,"If there is a Divine Crimsonite in the Sunstone Chamber,\nmonsters may attack.\nI'm worried about King Moonis and others who went there first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_40_6_1,"I see there's a mechanism that reacts to dancing.\nI wonder if the person who made it liked dancing?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_1_1,"Your ancestors left a treasure\nto your descendant, King Moonis."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_2_1,"...Wouldn't it be no good if the king of the country, Sama, sold the\nDivine Crimsonite?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_2_2,"I thought\nthat if it would make the country and people rich...\nThat's a difficult problem."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_3_1,"I'm glad King Moonis and I found Shiny Melon\n. Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_4_1,"I've been looking for some good junk, but it doesn't seem to be there!\nYou just have to get out of a place like this quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_5_1,"Like King Moonis's ancestors, I want to be able to\nextend a helping hand to my descendants when they are in trouble."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_6_1,"I'm glad that I was able to protect\nthe Pyramid Divine Crimsonite\nwith everyone in 『Shield of the Hero』."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_50_6_2,"I never thought\nthat King Moonis would want to sell\nthe God Divine Crimsonite."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_1_1,"I want to try Shiny Melon too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_2_1,"I hope that by growing shiny melons,\nthe Arahaghiro Kingdom's finances will be restored as soon as possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_2_2,"If it's a king like King Moonis who cares about the people, it'll be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_3_1,"I wonder what Shiny Melon tastes like?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_3_2,"Let's all eat together sometime! Mr.\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_4_1,"I thought you were a piece of crap like breaking a mirror, but\nyou were trying to protect the world...\nI was fooled too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_5_1,"King Moonis'\ngood fortune until he obtained the treasure was probably bestowed upon him by his ancestors."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_5_2,"In addition to Shiny Melons,\nKing Moonis' ancestors also gave us\ntreasures."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_6_1,"If you leave the rest to King Moonis\n, everything will be fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_443_200_6_2,"That's what your father said before.\nKing Moonis is a good king who takes\nhis country seriously..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_1_1,"Hot springs, huh... Sometimes I like to relax and\nrelieve travel fatigue."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_2_1,"Because of those monsters, people can't come to the\nhot springs..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_2_2,"Sucks that we can't take our time to rest our bodies\nby soaking in the hot springs, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_3_1,"To think that even monsters want to bath in the hot\nsprings..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_4_1,"How many times—ta think how many times we've been\nuseful people 'n' helpful; former junkie #2, I'm\ntotally astounded."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_5_1,"As it is with the monsters within the hot springs,\nother people will be unable to utilize them, and Ms.\nRugina, too, cannot perform her job as a caretaker."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_5_2,"Let us hurriedly go to the hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_1,"\"Gals\"...Anyway, I'm worried that the monsters will\ntorment people, you know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_2,"Monsero Hot Spring Ravine should have an old shrine\nthere... There may be a Divine Crimsonite."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_10_6_3,"Maybe the monsters that appeared came the Divine\nCrimsonite?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_1_1,"Since we have to deal with multiple monsters, this\ntime we'd better watch the opponents' movements even\nmore than usual, y'know!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_2_1,"To think that they're soaking in the hot springs\nbefore battle; they're super laid-back girls, see."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_3_1,"I want to go in the hot springs too...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_4_1,"Ta think there's places like this hot spring that\nheals 'n' cleans people; this ain't a respectable\nplace!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_4_2,"Let's hurry up 'n' defeat 'em, so we can get outta\nhere!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_5_1,"Those monsters spoke playfully, however when they\nescaped, their demeanor was not ordinary."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_5_2,"Let us carefully pursue them!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_20_6_1,"We cannot let the Divine Crimsonite be crushed!\n{pc}, let's rush to the shrine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_1_1,"We defeated the monsters that came to the hot springs.\nLet's go report back to Yakup."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_2_1,"Now that we've defeated the Great Demon King's\nminions, let's hurry back to old man Yakup, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_2_2,"...This steam and heat's making me sweat even more."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_3_1,"Only those monsters got to enjoy the hot springs,\nit's unfair!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_4_1,"Healing bodies 'n' Goddess Stones... Helpful ta\npeople, I haaate these hot springs!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_5_1,"Having defeated the monsters, as well as concentrated\npower into the Divine Crimsonite, people can relax\nat the hot springs, can they not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_5_2,"Let us go to Melun Waterwheel to inform Mr. Yakup\nabout what occurred at the hot springs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_1,"........."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_2,"Ahh, {pc}? Sorry. It's nothing. I was just\nthinking a little bit about something..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_3,"More importantly, I'm glad that we were able to\nprotect Monsero Hot Springs' Divine Crimsonite, you\nknow."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_4,"With the Divine Crimsonite protected by the Hero's\nPower, even Great Demon King himself shouldn't be\nable to meddle with it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_30_6_5,"...At any rate, those two Terrible Demon Generals were\nformidable enemies, weren't they. In various ways..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_1_1,"The Divine Crimsonite will continue to protect for a\nlong time..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_1_2,"With Ms. Rugina going about training a successor,\nhistory will be woven again, y'know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_2_1,"...When old man Yakup opens his mouth, it's only to talk\nabout \"gals\", huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_2_2,"...Well, if that's what keeps him alive and kicking,\nthen that's fine."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_3_1,"In the past, the hot springs' caretakers protected\nthe Divine Crimsonites, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_3_2,"Thanks to hot springs' caretakers, the Divine\nCrimsonite and the hot springs are still taken care\nof, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_4_1,"Ta think there's helpful water all over the place;\nI've already had enough o' these hot springs!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_5_1,"As Megistris Kingdom's successor, I, too, have even\nmore to learn..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_444_200_6_1,"Ms. Rugina has remembered the hot springs' caretakers'\nduty, so I can rest assured entrusting the Divine\nCrimsonite to her, you know."

PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_1_1,"It seems that the priests are not free, so\nwe should bring the spark for purification."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_2_1,"Do I have to go to the trouble of\na prayer ceremony to go to the place where the Tenkan is sitting?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_2_2,"Being a priest is tough."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_3_1,"If you use the purification spark dropped by the Twisted Torch,\nthe door to the Throne of Vow will open."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_3_2,"It feels strange that the fire dropped by monsters is helping the high priests."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_4_1,"It's an inconvenient place where you can't open the entrance unless you prepare the tools and perform the ritual!\nI've reconsidered it a bit!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_5_1,"The purification spark is said to be necessary for the Alltrades Abbey ritual, so\nlet's do what we can to help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_6_1,"I thought {pc} would help the High Priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_10_6_2,"Besides, the Alltrades Abbey is\none of the most sacred places in Lendersia, so it might have something to do with the Divine Crimsonites."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_1_1,"Now that I have obtained the spark of purification,\nthe High Priest will be able to\nperform the prayer ceremony."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_1_2,"Let's go back to Alltrades Abbey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_2_1,"Let's deliver the spark of purification to High Priest Sama."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_3_1,"This is the\nspark of purification that the High Priest needs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_3_2,"Let's get it quickly! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_4_1,"Even though fire is a free thing,\nit can be useful for many things, but\nI'm not interested in fire needed for important rituals!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_5_1,"It's a blue, gentle fire...\nAs the name suggests,\nit seems to have a mysterious power that cleanses impurities."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_6_1,"Come to think of it, I...\nAs the princess of Gran Zedora, I didn't greet the high priest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_20_6_2,"Last time you seemed busy with the appointment ceremony, so\nI had to give you a proper greeting when I handed you the spark of purification."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_1_1,"To have a dream in which the High Priest\ndestroys Dharma's divine object...\nis somehow ominous."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_1_2,"Let's go check out the deity."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_2_1,"If Dharma's divine object is really the divine Divine Crimsonite,\nthe dream that Grand Priest Sama had\nI hope doesn't actually happen..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_2_2,"If we go to the Vow Seat,\nwe might be able to stop it.\nLet's go."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_3_1,"Dharma's divine body wanted to\ntell the high priest\nthat he was in danger through his dream?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_3_2,"Even though I can't talk to you directly,\nI can see it in my dreams and let you know.\nAs expected of a deity."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_4_1,"Are you going to a place where there are things that are cherished by everyone?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_4_2,"If you have some junk,\nyou can take it with you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_5_1,"Indeed, the Alltrades Abbey is a suitable place to protect\nthe Divine Crimsonite."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_5_2,"After all, Dr. Rossum said that\nit is a keystone that protects the land of Lendersia from evil beings."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_30_6_1,"Maybe my hunch was right.\nI'm also curious about the high priest's dream.\nLet's go to the ritual room in the basement of the temple."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_1_1,"Dharma's sacred object may really be\nthe Divine Crimsonite.\nLet's go to the Throne of the Vow as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_2_1,"It's not easy to go to the Throne of Vow when it's so strictly controlled."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_3_1,"It seems difficult for monsters to enter\nthe Seat of Vow unless the high priest performs a ritual."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_4_1,"Is the ritual over?\nIn that case, let's go see if there is any junk in the place called the throne of prayer!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_5_1,"If it is necessary to perform such a ritual just to enter the throne of the Divine Vow\nthen the Divine Crimsonite may be the object of worship."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_40_6_1,"Let's go to the Seat of Vow too.\nIf we have the Divine Crimsonite, we have to pour\nthe power of the hero into it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_1_1,"A monster disguised as a high priest\nwas deceiving us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_1_2,"I'm worried about the safety of the real high priest!\nLet's find him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_2_1,"I don't think you would go to the trouble of disguising yourself as the High Priest Sama and get in our way..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_2_2,"Where is the real High Priest Sama...?\nWe need to find him quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_3_1,"The high priest who was disguised as a monster\nlooked just like the real thing, so\nI didn't notice it at all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_4_1,"It's a pain to enter, but\nIt's a terrible room with no junk!\nThe Alltrades Abbey is full of things like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_5_1,"I can't let my guard down at all for a monster disguised as a high priest to perform\na prayer ceremony."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_5_2,"The battle would have been dangerous if Princess Anlucia had not mastered\n'Eye of the Hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_6_1,"I'm glad I arrived in time to restore\nthe power of the Age of Gods to the divine Divine Crimsonite of the Alltrades Abbey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_50_6_2,"Now we just have to make sure the high priest is safe.\nLet's go look for him too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_1_1,"Thanks to the god Granzenis entrusting the\nstone to the god Dharma,\nwe have been protected and have survived."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_1_2,"Let us be thankful for the friendship of the gods."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_2_1,"After making the High Priest Sama immobile,\nI can't believe you're going to make it so that no one can see her."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_2_2,"That monster was quite cautious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_3_1,"I'm relieved that the real High Priest has been found!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_3_2,"You're trying to switch places with the high priest\nYou're a cunning monster!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_4_1,"It's a pity that the object of worship is not a piece of junk, but\nit's a memento of a friend of the deities, so I can't be so stingy with it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_5_1,"The High Priest is safe and\nthe Divine Crimsonite has regained\nits power from the age of the gods, so it's a relief."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_6_1,"{pc}.I'll say it now, but\nThe battle with the Phantom General was tough.\nI was so busy that I was dizzy because of the Phantom."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_445_200_6_2,"But I'm glad we were able to protect the Divine Crimsonite of Alltrades Abbey\n.\nThe High Priest was safe too, so we'll be fine now."

PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_1_1,"Gran Zedora Castle's secret underground meeting room...\nIf one searched this castle, there'd probably be lots\nof secrets, wouldn't there."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_2_1,"...Secret Crushing Evil Technique. Trials coming from the\nsages, means it's gotta be some unbelieve technique,\nhuh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_3_1,"Anlucia, as far as I see it, is strong enough even\nnow, although to learn that Secret Crushing Evil\nTechnique, she has to get even stronger..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_3_2,"{pc}, I'll do my best to become even\nstronger too, okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_4_1,"Goin' through the trouble of fixin' busted equipment?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_4_2,"I can't take the broken one 'n' they make a new one,\ncan I?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_5_1,"To think there is such a place as a secret meeting\nroom for the convening of sages; as expected of Gran\nZedora Kingdom, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_0_6_1,"Learning the Secret Crushing Evil Technique... To do that,\nfirst, we need to repair the device in the secret\nmeeting room, don't we. Let's see what Milt has to say."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_1_1,"In order for the Sages to convene, we have to quickly\nget the secret meeting room's device fixed, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_1_2,"Let's go to Ragi Snowfield."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_2_1,"...That troublesome geezer, huh. I get that he's a\nskilled engineer, but... We have no choice but to go, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_3_1,"Mr. Bajeo is the old man who had a fight with the\nGrand Titus' captain, wasn't he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_3_2,"He's related to Lady Lushenda. But Lady Lushenda\ndoesn't look anything like him at all, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_4_1,"Aah... The one with the nice, broken spanner we replaced\nwit' that gold 'n' gaudy high-tech one, and he talked\n'bout what a waste it was that one time..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_5_1,"I see. The time that we met has led here... The Pendulum\nof Fate's guidance is an amazing thing, is it not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_10_6_1,"The engineer, Bajeo, eh. He has a somewhat similar\npresence as Sage Hollow, so I remember him well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_1_1,"If Mr. Bajeo already knows what's broken with the\nequipment in the secret meeting room, then say no\nmore!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_1_2,"Let's defeat those killer machines and get the Magic\nMirror Lens!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_1,"Looks like the geezer engineer already knew about the\nequipment in the meeting room being broken, so did\nwe all need to go ask him?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_2,"Even if we left it alone, sooner or later he would've\ncame by, right."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_2_3,"Right now, there's a state of emergency, so we can't\nhave that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_3_1,"Mr. Bajeo knew that the equipment was broken from\nthe beginning."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_3_2,"In that case, when we get the materials, let's get it\nto him so he can fix it right away, okay!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_4_1,"If I remember correctly, before we could even go ta\nLendersia, we had ta do somethin' like this, yeah?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_4_2,"Let's hurry 'n' get this over wit', so we can get\nback ta searchin' for Lendersia's junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_5_1,"Come to think of it, when we met Mr. Bajeo prior, he\nwas concerned about Gran Zedora Castle's equipment,\nwas he not."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_1,"I'm glad that we should soon be able to obtain the\nmaterial necessary for the repairs."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_2,"Say, {pc}. This is our first task as the\nHero and Guiding Ally, isn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_3,"It's cool that you're good friends, but don't forget\nthat we're all here too, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_20_6_4,"Hehehe. We're all precious friends. Of course I'll\nrely on you all."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_1_1,"We have the Magic Mirror Lens, so let's go to the\nmeeting room! Mr. Bajeo should arrive there too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_2_1,"We got the Magic Mirror Lens, so let's quickly deliver\nit to the secret meeting room, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_3_1,"If he has the Magic Mirror Lens, he can repair the\ndevice, can't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_3_2,"Hurry, let's go to the secret meeting room,\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_4_1,"How's a weird pane of glass like this gonna help wit'\nrepairin'... Man, it's good-for-nothin', ain't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_5_1,"Mr. Bajeo—when he is finished preparing—will be\nheading towards Gran Zedora Castle, therefore, we too\nshould go to the secret meeting room."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_30_6_1,"Once the equipment in the secret meeting room has\nbeen repaired, I can finally attempt to master the\nHero's secret technique.\n<br>\nLet's prepare to take the test as well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_1_1,"Great-grandma Lushenda...? As far as I can see, Lady\nLushenda looks young, but...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_2_1,"Finally, the Princess can start the trials to get\nstronger, huh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_2_2,"...Looks like we'll get to train by protecting the\nPrincess too; I'm looking forward to it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_1,"The device in the secret meeting room can project the\nimages of people far away and let them talk, right.\n<br>\nTo think that he repaired it so easily; Mr. Bajeo's\namazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_2,"But he said that Lady Lushenda was his great-grandma...\nWas that some kind of joke?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_3_3,"........."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_4_1,"What's wit' that device! I don't wanna be anywhere\nnear somethin' useful thing like that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_5_1,"......Eh? Earlier, was it true—what we witnessed being\nsaid?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_5_2,"Uhh... I... That answer will not be coming from my\nmouth..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_6_1,"At last, the time to master the Hero's secret\ntechnique has come, hasn't it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_447_200_6_2,"Is it okay if I leave which Sage's trial we begin with\nto you, <pc>? I want you to decide."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_1_1,"'Hero's Eye'... If Anlucia masters it, that'll be\nreassuring for all of us too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_1_2,"Let's go to the Monster Arena in the True World's\nArahaghiro Kingdom! I'm sure there'll be an amazing\ntrial waiting there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_2_1,"Even if you think you can't be fooled by monsters'\ntricks, there's magic that can still deceive you, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_2_2,"It is because overestimating one's abilities may not\nbe for the best."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_3_1,"A technique to break through the monsters' deceptions...\nAnlucia's learning a hard sounding art, isn't she..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_4_1,"Ta think ya're tryin' ta get rid o' the pleasure o'\nbein ripped off by phony junk... Ya've got a grudge\nagainst me, don'tcha!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_5_1,"Master Broggen's trial—what in the world do you\nthink it could be?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_1,"By discerning the truth or falsehood of things, a\ntechnique to break through monster's fabricated lies:\nthe 'Hero's Eye'..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_2,"No matter how much power you have, if one is mislead\nby deception, winning against a monster in battle\nisn't possible."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_10_6_3,"I think it will be useful in our future battles."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_1_1,"To think we defeated such a formidable monster with\nAnlucia's help..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_1_2,"The Hero & Guiding Ally's power is unbelievable."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_2_1,"...That Abominable Showman guy was kind of a tough\nenemy, huh..."

PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_2_2,"There are only monsters prepared by the sage. Trial monsters are strong."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_3_1,"To me, real monsters and fake monsters look the same, but Anlucia is amazing!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_4_1,"I don't understand how you can go out of your way to see through something that is more useless than the real thing. It's a fake!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_5_1,"It's truly a secret technique to break down a fake that is indistinguishable from the real thing."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_448_20_6_1,"Thanks to everyone, I was able to acquire the Hero's Eye. Now I don't have to be afraid of deception anymore."

PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_1_1,"Poison Fang Hall...sounds dangerous.\nI'm worried about being poisoned, but\nLet's keep our heads together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_2_1,"The old man in Eidos is a poison test...\nThe one in the Poison Fang Room seems creepy..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_2_2,"I need the princess to clear the trials and become even stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_3_1,"I wonder if it's a test using poison...?\nIt feels kind of scary..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_4_1,"Poison Fang Hall! What a wonderful name!\nThere must be a lot of helpless junk lying around!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_5_1,"Maybe in the Popora region of the Pukland continent...\nI never thought I would return to Pukland for the trial of the evil-destroying technique."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_6_1,"'Hero's Shield'... It's a technique that protects not only me but\n{pc} and everyone else.\nIt would be very reassuring if I could learn it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_10_6_2,"I have already experienced how difficult it is to fight alone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_1_1,"If we didn't have Anlucia's ""Hero Shield"", we would\nhave been attacked by the monster's poison."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_1_2,"The power of the hero\nis great after all..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_2_1,"That guy from Anlucia, after overcoming the trials\nhe really became stronger..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_2_2,"We also want to emulate Princess Anlucia and become even stronger."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_3_1,"Fighting a poisonous monster was\nscary, but Anlucia protected me\nso I could fight with peace of mind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_4_1,"Well, it was a nice cave full of poison!\nIt would have been better if there were some junk, but\nI'll forgive you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_5_1,"No matter how much you train your body,\nit's difficult to overcome poison, so\nI'm sure it will help you in your future battles."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_1,"...Hey {pc}.\nI was able to acquire the ""Hero's Shield"", but\nI really wanted to say something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_2,"At that time, all my thoughts about wanting to learn techniques\ndisappeared somewhere\nand all I thought about was protecting everyone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_3,"I was able to realize once again that the desire to protect one's friends\ngives birth to such great power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_449_20_6_4,"I want to be able to protect more and more people.\nThat is my role as a hero!"

PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_1_1,"I'm more worried about Hollow than about the trial."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_1_2,"Even though he's a wise man, he's still an old man.\nI'd be worried if he got caught up in the trouble.\nLet's go find the old man!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_2_1,"The hollow old man\nI bet he was found by the Demon King's minions..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_2_2,"If that's the case, Hollow is\nin danger!\nLet's go find him right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! It's tough!\nLet's go to Mr. Hollow quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_4_1,"Isn't it just that the device is broken again?\nIf that's the case, don't try to repair it this time.\nIs it okay if I take it for you?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_5_1,"Mr. Hollow looked as if he was\nfighting with someone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_5_2,"As Milt said,\nit would be better to check on Mr. Hollow's safety."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_1,"That Hollow looked so flustered...\nSomething might have happened."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_2,"{pc}!\nHurry up and find Mr. Hollow!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_10_6_3,"...But where are you?\nThe last time I met you was\non the Earth Ark..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_1_1,"I'm relieved that Hollow is safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_1_2,"...There is no guarantee that the Great Demon King will not interfere..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_2_1,"...There's also the Anlucia trial, and\nI need Sage Sama to stay healthy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_2_2,"He's a grandpa, so\nI was really worried..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_3_1,"Even the wise man could get hurt\n.\nI was worried."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_3_2,"You were your usual energetic enamel.\n{pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_4_1,"I'm making you guys worry.\nActually, you're fine, you're such a bother!\nI'm starting to like you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_5_1,"I'm glad that Hollow was uninjured and seems to be doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_5_2,"I heard that the trial of the secret skill of destroying evil will be held on the top floor of Rinja Tower in the True World.\nLet's head there too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_6_1,"Share your heart of courage with your friends\nThe secret skill of drawing out great power, the ""Hero's Heart""...\nI want to learn it no matter what."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_20_6_2,"Raising the power of your allies is\nthe perfect secret technique for us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_1_1,"When I see Anlucia overcome her ordeal and become stronger\n, I feel motivated too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_2_1,"...The enamel old man is\nreally a free and wise man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_3_1,"I feel like my heart has become\nstronger than it was before the journey began!\nThanks to everyone and {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_4_1,"A magical statue that confuses people!\nI would rather have that\nthan a secret technique!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_4_2,"Oh no, it's just too much of a hindrance."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_5_1,"Share your heart of courage with your friends...\nIt's much more amazing than I imagined.\nIt's truly a secret technique only available to the brave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_1,"I was able to acquire the ""Hero's Heart"" thanks to\nyou, my ally, and everyone\nfighting together."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_2,"Even if I am called a hero,\nthere is a limit to what I can do by myself.\nThis trial made me realize once again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_3,"But, I thought that if we all combined our\npowers, there would be no enemy\nthat we could not defeat."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_35_450_30_6_4,"From now on, let's all work together and fight\nthe army of the Great Demon King!\nNice to meet you {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_1_1,"Anlucia's power will lead to\ndefeating the Great Demon King, so\nlet's hurry up and take the next trial!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_2_1,"Hurry up and take the next test.\nThe wise old men are waiting for you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\nI wonder what kind of test we will face next?\nI have to do my best to become even stronger!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_4_1,"I don't want to use the sage all the time, but\nIt's not bad to be able to see rare things.\nI'll keep going!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_5_1,"There are still trials left, so\nPrincess Anlucia can become even stronger.\nWe can't afford to lose either."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_36_6_1,"{pc}.\nWhen you are ready, take the next trial."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_1_1,"To think they took advantage of Milt's grief after\nlosing his beloved friend...! I won't forgive them!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_2_1,"...That Milt guy gave the Prince's body to the demons...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_2_2,"It's unforgivable, but he must have had his own\nconflicts, huh..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_3_1,"Milt gave the body to the demons because he was at\nsuch a loss clinging to the late Prince Toma, wasn't\nhe..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_4_1,"Looks like even a seemin'ly brilliant person like\nthat Milt was actually bein' duped by those demons;\nhe's junky, ain't he."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_4_2,"Still, it'd take him 'bout 100 years ta beat someone\nlike me in junkiness! Betta luck next time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_5_1,"Once, I would have used the wish-granting notebook's\npower to revive my father, so perhaps I am not\nqualified to speak..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_5_2,"However, to utilize the grief of another losing a\nloved one for one's own ambitions, I absolutely\nwill not forgive that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_1,"...I once believed that I would become the Guiding\nAlly of the Hero, my Big Brother, so that I could\nsupport him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_2,"But the truth was that I am the Hero and Big Brother\nmy Guiding Ally. And Big Brother is..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_3,"But now, {pc}. You, my Guiding Ally, and\nour friends here. That's why I can still fight."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_4,"As the Hero, I will defeat Great Demon King Madesagora\nand free Big Brother Toma. Until then, I will never\ngive up."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_37_6_5,"Until the end, you'll stay by my side, won't you,\n{pc}......"

PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_1_1,"The monsters that tried to destroy the Divine Crimsonite were all powerful enemies that could not be defeated without\nAnlucia's power."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_2_1,"...We managed to protect the remaining Divine Crimsonite."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_3_1,"The enemy monsters were all strong, but\nwe also became strong, so we were able to protect the Divine Crimsonite!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_4_1,"I was so useless that God somehow protected me, but since I found all kinds of junk, I will forgive you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_5_1,"I'm glad I was able to protect all three of the remaining Divine Crimsonites."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_5_2,"I hope this will stop the erosion of the world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_40_6_1,"We were finally able to regain the\npower of the three remaining God Divine Crimsonites.\nLet's go back to report to Lady Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_1_1,"You are planning to block our path by destroying the Pendulum of Fate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_1_2,"Let's go to Solaria Canyon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_2_1,"You Demon King...\nI'm sure he's not planning something\nthat isn't even Roku..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_3_1,"The Pendulum of Fate has been broken..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_3_2,"You're taking away all of our efforts..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_4_1,"A broken pendulum is useless!\nThen why don't you give it to me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_5_1,"...Let's go to Solaria Canyon.\nWhere the Pendulum of Fate led\nbefore it was destroyed."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_5_2,"Even if the pendulum is broken, we have no choice but to\nfollow the path shown."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_1,"The Pendulum of Fate may be broken, but\nthat doesn't mean our destiny is broken as well..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_2,"As Lucenda said,\nYou must create your own destiny!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_3,"'Let's head to Solaria Canyon right away.\nI'm sure something is going on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_50_6_4,"If fate is\nheading in the wrong direction, let us guide you\nto the right path!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_1_1,"It's different from the previous Solaria Canyon...\nThere's a sense of unease here."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_1_2,"I'm scared, but for everyone's sake\nI have to go...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_2_1,"...What is that creepy thing?\nLast time I came here,\nnothing like that was floating in the sky."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_2_2,"The terrain has changed\nto something ominous...\nLet's keep our guard up and move on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_3_1,"{pc}...\nI'm scared of Solaria Canyon right now..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_3_2,"But since you and {pc} are here, I'll do my best..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_4_1,"What is that?! That place in the sky looks like there might be junk!\nYou should go there quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_5_1,"What is that\ndeceptive object floating in the sky?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_5_2,"...It seems better to proceed\ncarefully from here on out."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_6_1,"That deceptive object floating in the transformed Solaria Canyon...\nI need to investigate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_53_6_2,"It's okay.\nWhatever fate awaits us, we should be able to\nface it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_1_1,"Even if I show you the appearance of Hades Nergel,\n{pc} will not be afraid of!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_1_2,"You better not take us lightly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_2_1,"Hey! {pc}!\nI'm sure you understand, but\nI'm not going to lose to the embodiment of fear!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_2_2,"Let's defeat that guy who just looks like!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_3_1,"Even if something scary appears to me,\n{pc},\nI believe that you will not lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2, you can get over your own fears. It's boring, even if you're a person, I know that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_5_1,"{pc} can\novercome that fear!\nAbsolutely...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_6_1,"You will not be defeated by the fear lurking in your heart.\nI will help you again and again."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_55_6_2,"I'm the same way. No matter what fear stands in my way,\nas long as you're by my side, I'll be fine.\nSo {pc} let's fight without giving up!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_1,"I want to defeat the Great Demon King right away, but\nit's impossible unless I break the barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_2,"After all, we can't move forward here unless we borrow\nwisdom from Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_1_3,"...It's very sad to have to come all this way and start all over again, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_2_1,"Damn it...!\nWe're almost there until the Great Demon King\nWhy are you being hindered by a barrier like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_3_1,"If we don't enter the Demon Palace, we won't be able to defeat the Great Demon King!\n{pc}, I'm frustrated...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_1,"Is there\njunk in the Great Demon King's castle?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_2,"If that's the case,\nwe'll break in right away!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_4_3,"There's a barrier and I can't get through it.\nI'll talk to Lushenda, so\nI'll go back to Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_5_1,"You cannot defeat the Great Demon King unless you destroy the\nbarrier that blocks your path to the Great Demon King's throne."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_5_2,"Let's go back to Gran Zedora Castle.\nI'm sure Lushenda will be able to give me some advice."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_1,"The power of the Great Demon King is immeasurable for him to be able to manifest the fear hidden in your heart into a monster like that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_2,"But you didn't give in to that fear.\nAnd I and everyone else are with you.\nI'm sure you can defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_60_6_3,"But before that, we have to do something to\ncreate a barrier to protect the Phantom Palace...\nLet's talk to Lushenda."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_1_1,"It would be reassuring if the sages of the Crown of Wisdom could\nlocate\nPegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_1_2,"Finding a Pegasus that we don't know may exist...\nIt's like catching a cloud..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_2_1,"Pegasus...?\nDoes such a creature\nexist in this world?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_2_2,"You may have only heard about it in fairy tales."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_3_1,"Does Pegasus really exist?\nIf so, I would really like to meet him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_4_1,"Are you looking for a horse that can fight bad guys and fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_4_2,"That horse...\nIt would be nice if it was a flop.\nIt seems like there's little hope..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_5_1,"If we don't find Pegasus, it seems unlikely that we will be able to\nbreak the barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_5_2,"Even Lady Lushenda seems to be doubting the existence of Pegasus, so it looks like it will take a long time to find it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_1,"...Hey, {pc} is worried about whether Pegasus will actually be found?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_2,"I strongly...strongly believe that Pegasus will\nappear before us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_3,"Because the ally mentioned in the legend\nhas really appeared and is still\nby my side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_4,"If Pegasus, your allies, and your\nfriends lend you their power,\neven the Great Demon King will not be your enemy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_6_5,"There must have been some progress in the investigation.\nLet's listen to Lady Lushenda's story."

PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_1_1,"If you can ride the flying dragon using the dragon flute that Mr. Crows gave you, you can go to the island of Etene, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_1_2,"But riding a flying dragon...\nYou're talking about Pegasus.\nYou mentioned another amazing creature."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_2_1,"It's a flute that controls flying dragons...\nThe Crows guy has\neverything."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_2_2,"Earlier, a musical instrument craftsman on the beach of Kokorata was asked by a person named Kuro to make a special flute... Could that be...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_3_1,"We're going to\nthe island of Ethene on a flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_3_2,"I wonder what kind of ride the Hiryu is like?\nWill I be able to ride it properly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_4_1,"It's the hometown of the former Junkie No. 2, so\nI'm sure there's some good junk here!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_4_2,"Please guide me properly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_5_1,"Looks like the only way to land on the island of Ethene is to fly\nthrough the sky..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_5_2,"There's no other option.\nI'll blow the dragon flute that the Crows gave me and get\nthe flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_6_1,"Pegasus is healing the\nscars from his previous battle with the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_10_6_2,"...No. I'm also interested in Pegasus, but\nI need to find the wyvern first."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_1_1,"Let's go to\nWyvern Peak to find your partner, the wyvern that Mr. Wandora said."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_2_1,"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of flying dragon\nwill be attracted by {pc}'s whistle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_3_1,"I wonder what kind of flying dragon will come...\nI hope it's a kind flying dragon..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_4_1,"Former Junkie No. 2!\nThe flying dragon you call should definitely be\na bare flying dragon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_4_2,"I would like to refrain from riding a bare dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_5_1,"Pegasus and the flying dragon...\nIt's too late now, but I feel like I've stepped into a fairy tale."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_5_2,"We've even met the fairy tale hero\nZankrone.\nIt's nothing surprising, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_6_1,"I will ask {pc}\nyou to play the dragon flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_20_6_2,"I...\nI'm not good at playing musical instruments."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_1_1,"I didn't think {pc}'s flute tone was\nterrible, but\nHiryu and us feel it differently."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_2_1,"It looks like that white dragon will give you a flying dragon\n, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_2_2,"The sound of {pc}'s whistle\nseems to be pretty bad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_3_1,"The sound of {pc}'s flute...\nI didn't notice it though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_4_1,"Ta think ya made an annoyin' flute tone. As expected\no' former Junkie No. 2, ain't it! I've reconsidered\nya!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_5_1,"Does that mean that the white dragon was\ninterested in {pc}'s strength?\nIt didn't seem to like the sound of the flute..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_5_2,"Let's go back\nto Mr. Wandora, the dragon protector. We have to check out the\ngood thing that the white dragon sent us earlier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_6_1,"You're such a rude dragon that the tone of {pc}'s dragon flute is boring or harsh!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_30_6_2,"If that doesn't work,\nIf I blow it,\nI don't know how much people will criticize it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_1_1,"I never expected the white dragon from earlier to\ngive me such a magnificent egg..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_1_2,"I wonder if you\ntrusted us unexpectedly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_2_1,"...Amazing\nIt's the first time I've seen a flying dragon egg."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_2_2,"I wonder what kind of person is inside the egg\nI hope to meet you soon!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_3_1,"That means he gave us an egg in response, that will\nhatch a baby flying dragon, doesn't it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_3_2,"We all will be its parents, won't we. I can help,\ncan't I?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_1,"That white dragon from earlier gave us that flyin'\ndragon egg, yeah?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_2,"Since he was sayin' it'd be a good thing, I figured\nhe was gonna give us some splendid junk; guess I\nmisunderstood..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_4_3,"Former Junkie No. 2, there ain't any other gifts,\nyeah?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_5_1,"I never thought the dragon king would bring us\ndragon eggs..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_5_2,"I didn't like his pompous attitude, but despite that,\nhe may have been a surprisingly good-natured guy,\nhuh."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_40_6_1,"If the egg is that big,\nwill the newly born flying dragon be able to carry all of us\nand fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_1_1,"Warm up the egg with the dragon flame stone and have the dragon show its face to you as soon as possible.　"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_1_2,"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of girl she is!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_2_1,"It's a tough job to be a Dragon Guardian,\nto have to live in such a rugged and inhospitable land."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_3_1,"Dragon Flame Stone sounds like a very hot name.\nI wonder if the egg will be boiled..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_4_1,"A warm stone that can hatch eggs...\nI don't even want to use it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_1,"I wonder how hot it is inside the egg heated by the dragon flame stone..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_2,"It's enough to hatch an egg.\nIsn't it a good temperature for a flying dragon?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_5_3,"It's so hot that the Hiryu\nmight jump out."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_46_6_1,"Now that you have collected the dragon flame stones, all you have to do is go back to Mr. Wandora's house and hatch the dragon egg."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_1_1,"Even though it just hatched from an egg,\nthat flying dragon is doing really well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_1_2,"If you can fly that high in the sky,\nI think you can reach the island of Ethene\nin no time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_2_1,"It looks like Hiryuu is enjoying\nthe outside world for the first time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_3_1,"The adult wyvern was scary, but\nthis newborn baby is\nso cute!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_4_1,"I hate such useful creatures that can\ncarry people and fly right after birth!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_4_2,"Even when Chiri was a baby, she was useless,\ncrying all the time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_5_1,"It felt so good\nto fly in the sky...\nI'm a little jealous."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_6_1,"It looks like you're\nattached to that boy {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_50_6_2,"Come on.\nLet me call you by blowing the flute."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_1_r7000,"It's a little unsteady, but... The feel of riding a\nflying dragon's not bad, is it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_2_1_r7000,"This is surprisingly high in the sky for it's first\ntime..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_1_r7000,"The height and ride feel are different than the\nAzlantelopes...! This may be the first time I've looked\nat the ground from such a high place...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_2_r7000,"If you look too far down, you'll fall!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_4_1_r7000,"Please get me down from here! Ridin' a useful\ncreature like this is convenient!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_5_1_r7000,"So high... I cannot stop worrying about falling, however,\nit is somewhat fun!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_1_r7000,"I never told anybody, but, you know, flying in the\nair was my dream!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_2_r7000,"Ever since I was a kid and saw picture-books of\nHeroes riding Pegasus, I've always, alwaaays wanted\nto do it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_3_r7000,"To think that I rode a flying dragon through the sky\nbefore Pegasus, I never imagined that!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_4_r7000,"All that's left is to find Pegasus; if we fly side by\nside with him, it will be even lovelier, won't it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_1,"At first, I was nervous, but <pc_hiryu> seems to\ntrust us completely."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_1_2,"Let's go show him to the Sage afterwards, got it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_2_1,"That <pc_hiryu> guy... He's got brains, so he should\nunderstand what we're saying. He's reliable!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_1,"It's nice feeling the wind, high up on <pc_hiryu>;\nI love it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_3_2,"Fuura, you looked like you were having fun, y'know."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_4_1,"Ta think we rode on somethin' useful like that\nflying dragon; that was the worst, but I did see\nsome probable junk far off in the distance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_5_1,"Lady Lushenda, too, should pleasantly receive\n<pc_hiryu>, therefore let us go to Gran Zedora Castle."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_60_6_1,"We can ride <pc_hiryu> to fly through the air, so\nlet's report back to Lady Lushenda... With that, we'll\nfinally met Pegasus, won't we."

PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_1_1,"The search for\nPegasus will now begin in earnest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_1_2,"In order to defeat the Great Demon King, we must quickly find\nPegasus!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_2_1,"The day will come when I will travel on a flying dragon."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_2_2,"When you travel with {pc}, you never\nget bored."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_3_1,"Pegasus... where is he?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_3_2,"I don't think it will be easy to find, but\nyou won't have to spend too much time\nlooking for it..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_4_1,"Wherever the former Junkie No. 2 goes,\nthere is usually\njunk that I like!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_4_2,"I'm going to go find a flying horse\nfor junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_5_1,"We're landing on the island of Ethene...\nThere's not much information about Pegasus, but\nWe'll definitely find it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_1,"The island of Ethene in the inland sea of ​​Lendersia...I wonder where on the island\nPegasus heals wounds?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_2,"I hope that you have regained enough power to fight alongside Princess Anlucia."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_80_466_200_6_3,"It was\na long time ago that Pegasus and the previous hero fought against the Great Demon King, right?\nThen wouldn't it be okay?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_1_1,"If we don't return the turtle to Pegasus,\nwe can't go to the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_1_2,"First of all, let's look for the\nTense flower that Mr. Crows mentioned.\nThere should be a clue to it on the island of Ethene."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_2_1,"In order to bring Pegasus back after it turned into a turtle,\nthat Tenth Flower is needed, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_2_2,"This is getting a bit complicated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_3_1,"The turtle was a Pegasus...\nUnless Mr. Crows explains it to you,\nyou'll never know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_4_1,"I like the current turtle even though it seems useless!\nIs it no good as it is now!?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_5_1,"To return the turtle to Pegasus\nFind the lost Tenth flower..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_5_2,"Mr. Crows' words are very mysterious."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_6_1,"The guardian deity of your hometown, the Turtle, was the current form of\nPegasus..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_6_2,"It must be fate to have a connection with\nyou, the hero's ally, in a place like this."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_1_1,"...It's not {pc}'s fault, but\n{pc}'s brother is involved.\nI guess we'll have no choice but to resolve it ourselves."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_1_2,"When I heard Mr. Issho's story,\nyou are amazing brothers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_2_1,"I thought\ncame here to look for the Tenth Flower...\nIs this {pc}'s brother's butt wipe...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_2_2,"Issho's old man, you're all right, aren't you?\nWell, I guess I'll have no choice but to bring you some rainbow-colored pyroxene\nas a nuisance fee."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_3_1,"It's wrong for {pc} to get\nangry instead of {pc}'s brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_3_2,"Issho doesn't seem to be willing to listen to me, though..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_4_1,"It's great to meet\nthe brother of former Junkie No. 2! I wonder what kind of\nwonderful trouble he's going to cause me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_5_1,"Mr. Isshou is\nunderstandable to be angry, but Mr. {pc} is paying\nan inconvenience fee..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_5_2,"I wish there was some other way, but\nfor now, it might be better to find the stone and give it to you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_1,"I guess you have a brother after all.\nI kind of understand that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_2,"Yes...When I talk to you,\nI can't put it into words clearly, but\nI get the feeling that I have a brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_3,"Also, as Isshou said,\nI'm not the kind of person who would repay a favor in an additional way."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_10_6_4,"I would like you to tell me what your brother is like someday."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_1_1,"Rainbow-colored pyroxene...\nIt's a beautiful stone that doesn't look like\nshould be treated as a nuisance fee."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_2_1,"If you bring the rainbow-colored pyroxene,\nIsshou's old man will be satisfied."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_3_1,"If I give you the rainbow-colored pyroxene,\nIssho will probably forgive you, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_4_1,"Is this stone a substitute for a trouble fee?\nI don't hate the word 'nuisance', but\nI'm not interested in a sparkling stone like this!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_5_1,"They're asking for a precious stone as a nuisance fee, so\nI shouldn't keep you waiting.\nLet's go back to Mr. Isshou's house."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_20_6_1,"I got the trouble money for Mr. Issho.\nNow, can you tell me something\nabout {pc}'s brother?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_1_1,"As a father, Mr. Isshou also\ntried to protect his daughters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_2_1,"Issho's old man is worried that his daughter and {pc}'s brother were being chased by\nsome dangerous guys."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_2_2,"I feel like I can\nunderstand your desire to test us..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_3_1,"Mr. Isshou is very kind and\nfamily-oriented..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_4_1,"I was angry and asked him to pay me for the inconvenience, but he started saying that he wasn't really angry.\nI don't understand him. He's an old man."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_5_1,"My daughters were being chased by dangerous debt collectors.\nIt's no wonder they suspected us."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_5_2,"Mr. Issho seems to know\nthe whereabouts of Mr. {pc}'s brother, so\nlet's listen to him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_467_200_6_1,"Even though it's about {pc}'s brother\n60 years ago, it seems confusing,\nLet's hear the story in more detail."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_1_1,"You never know when a person's life will end\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_1_2,"I understand very well\nIssho's desire to see his family after he left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_2_1,"For the sake of Isshou's old man,\nsomehow find\n{pc}'s brothers..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_2_2,"This happened 60 years ago...\nIt seems like a difficult story..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_3_1,"Mr. {pc}! Let's let\nMr. Issho meet your daughters!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_3_2,"I'm sad that I won't be able to see my family\nfor a long time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_4_1,"Chiri has become a great person, but if I never see you again, will I regret\nwhen I die?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_4_2,"You will definitely regret it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_5_1,"It's heartbreaking that I won't be able to see my family until I die.I feel for my family.\nI want to fulfill Mr. Isshou's request."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_5_2,"I will interview Mr. Issho\nin the Kingdom of Gran Zedora so that he will not regret it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_6_1,"Sixty years ago,\nMr. Flasco lived in Gran Zedora Castle Town...\nFirst, let's ask him about that person."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_10_6_2,"It's okay.\nI'm sure someone knows something."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_1_1,"It was unfortunate that Mr. Flask, who was my reliable friend, had passed away, but\nI was able to hear some useful information from Mr. Salmar."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_1_2,"It would be nice if Daira remembered\nthe past..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_2_1,"I thought {pc}'s brothers and Lilior were\nbastards for sure, but..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_2_2,"Maybe he's a nice guy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_3_1,"Mr. Flask, you've passed away.\nMr. Issho, you must be sad..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_4_1,"Was your brother an excellent guy who also helped others?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_4_2,"You're betraying my expectations by making me think you're a piece of crap.\nYou look exactly like someone!\nHey, are you the former Junkie No. 2?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_5_1,"Mr. Flask had passed away, but\nhis grandson, Mr. Salmer, knew\nthe story of that time, which was helpful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_20_6_1,"It was 60 years ago after all...\nI might be lucky if there were other people\nwho seemed to remember what happened back then."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_1_1,"I can't believe you have\nthe power to save many people...\nBrothers look alike."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_1_2,"You're a wonderful brother that I respect!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_2_1,"I never knew that {pc}'s brother was an alchemist."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_2_2,"You alchemized drugs and you got melazo fever.\nYou saved a lot of people, right?\nAren't you big guys?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_1,"Dairah also knew\nthe man in the suspicious sunglasses."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_2,"It seems like\nthey were persistently chasing Lilior and the others across the ocean, so I wonder if those two are still safe."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_3_3,"I feel like I'm still doing well."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_4_1,"The brother of the former Junkie 2 was\nthe kind of person who could help someone in trouble!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_4_2,"You'll like it even more than the\nimpression you got when you heard it from the old man who paid the nuisance fee!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_5_1,"Could {pc}'s brother and Lilior be able to alchemize\ndrugs because\nthey were researching plants...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_1,"Perhaps because we were being chased by a suspicious man,\nwe had a hard time reaching {pc}'s brother and Lilior's location."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_2,"But I feel like I'll get there soon.\nMy ring is very accurate."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_30_6_3,"Don't rush, let's look for\nbased on the information we have so far."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_1_1,"The rainbow-colored pyroxene was originally used for\nLilior's pendant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_1_2,"I'm glad that Mr. Issho and his son were able to\nbond once again across time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_2_1,"The key to the Tenth Flower is\nIsshou's old man holds the\nkey."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_2_2,"Let's go get\nthat key quickly so that the old man doesn't forget it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_1,"I'm glad Lilior liked the rainbow-colored pyroxene pendant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_2,"I'm sure Mr. Issho would be happy too..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_3_3,"I'm starting to want to\nmeet my father too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_4_1,"You remembered the gift for your daughter, but you forgot about the important letter."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_4_2,"The old man named Isshou was actually a bit of an idiot...\nThat's really good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_5_1,"What did {pc}'s brother entrust to\nIssho?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_5_2,"If it leads you\nto the Tenth Flower, you should\nhurry up and accept it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_6_1,"Isshou and Lilior\n, I'm glad we were able to reconnect\nwith our bond."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_40_6_2,"Let's report to Mr. Issho and ask\nabout the key to the flower that was sent to him."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_1_1,"...No matter what happens, the bond between parent and child will never be broken..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_1_2,"I'm sure my father is also\nworried about me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_2_1,"Isshou's old man must have been keeping\nsomething."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_2_2,"I just hope\nthat Mr. Isshou hasn't thrown it away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_3_1,"Mr. Issho, it's been a long time since I last heard\nyour daughter's story.I'm glad to hear from you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_4_1,"He was a bad guy when he thanked us, but\nhe left his precious letter alone.\nThat old man loved it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_5_1,"Isshou seems relieved to know about Lilior's current situation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_6_1,"Until I find what I'm looking for,\nIssho, let's take your word for it and take a walk."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_468_200_6_2,"I would like you to tell me about the island of Ethene where you lived...."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_1_1,"I have never heard of\nthe Pearl of the Wind..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_2_1,"What is that pig?\nI told you to go find the pearl of the wind\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_3_1,"I can't imagine what a pearl of the wind is...\nWill the wind blow if I touch it?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_4_1,"What that pig needs is\nThe Pearl of the Wind seems to be valuable!\nI want you to search for something more worthless!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_5_1,"Mr. Issho said that the letter he entrusted to you contained something like\na pearl..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_5_2,"You may have found the letter by now, so why not check it out?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_10_6_1,"There are pigs that can talk!\nIf possible, I'd like to help you find what you're looking for..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_1_1,"Give Hana the\nPearl of the Wind given to you by {pc}'s brother."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_1_2,"Maybe she knows something\nabout Tens flowers."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_2_1,"The pearl of the wind in the letter\nis the one who said earlier that the pig was looking for it\n, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_3_1,"Hana asked you to bring\nthe Pearl of the Wind, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_3_2,"It might be something important, so let's give it to Hana quickly!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_4_1,"I don't think I can understand\nthat pig who wants such a valuable pearl!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_5_1,"The pearl of the wind that was in the letter is the item that\nHana wanted..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_5_2,"I'm also interested in the boy Mr. Issho mentioned\n, so I think it would be best to give him\nto Mr. Hana right away."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_20_6_1,"The key to the Tenth Flower is the pearl of the wind that the pig was looking for...?\nWhat does it mean?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_1_1,"Let's wait in front of the rock door in Lazea's Wind Cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_1_2,"I feel like I can finally meet\nthe Tens flower..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_2_1,"Hana will guide you\nto where the Tens flower is."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_2_2,"You're a solid pig."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_3_1,"It's finally time to return the turtle to Pegasus\nYou can see the Tenth flower!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_4_1,"Is it the Wind Cave of Lazea?\nIt sounds like there might be some good junk in there!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_5_1,"If the flower in Hana's words is\nthe Tenth flower...\nLet's hurry to the rock door of Razea's wind cave."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_1,"I guess all you have to do is wait\nfor the pig to fly in the wind hole in Lazea."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_2,"...What?\nAre you flying away? A pig...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_30_6_3,"How does it fly?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_1_1,"{pc}'s brother\npaved the way for the Tenth Flower with his own hands..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_2_1,"For the sake of\n{pc}'s brother who alchemized the Tenth Flower,\nthe Great Demon King must be defeated."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_3_1,"{pc}'s brother\nhas worked hard\nfor {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_3_2,"I'm jealous of you\nfor having such a kind brother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_4_1,"I was looking for what kind of junk\nmy brother, the former Junkie No. 2, has, but it seems like he doesn't have anything good!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_5_1,"A shining tenth flower that I spent my life alchemizing.\nWe cannot let the fruit of that effort go to waste."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_6_1,"Even though {pc}'s brothers are apart,\nthey have always been thinking about you.\nThe brightness of the tenth flower seems to represent that."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_83_469_50_6_2,"In order to respond to those feelings,\nlet us fulfill our mission!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_1_1,"With Hana's guidance, I was able to obtain\nthe Shining Tenth Flower."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_1_2,"The only thing left to do is to\nreturn the turtle to his original Pegasus form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_2_1,"Hana's guy...\nHe finally finished his job\nHe looked relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_2_2,"I've been waiting\nfor a long time for {pc} to come.\nLet's let him get some rest."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_3_1,"I hope Hana can spend some time relaxing\nfrom now on."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_4_1,"I'm not interested in a\npig who has completed his task to the end!\nI can take a nap and take it easy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_4_2,"Are you trying to\ntake care of Hana in your own way, Duston?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_5_1,"To be able to create a creature like Hana..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_5_2,"As an alchemist, {pc}'s sibling's\nskills were quite unparalleled."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_6_1,"The time has finally come for the turtle to regain his\nPegasus form."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_90_6_2,"It's almost time to borrow the power of Pegasus and break through\nthe\nbarrier of Great Demon King Madesagora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_1_1,"Wow...\nI've never seen such a beautiful white horse..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_1_2,"This looks exactly like\nfor a hero to ride."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_2_1,"Having come this far, Crows was\na different person..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_2_2,"The original Shin-yi seems to be\nkind."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_3_1,"The appearance of Tenma Falchion\nIt was so beautiful, Mr. {pc}!\nI was impressed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_4_1,"I liked turtles that stayed still\n, but now they turn into horses with wings!\nI want them to return to their original form!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_4_2,"The current appearance of Pegasus is\nits original appearance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_5_1,"Mr. Shinyi...?\nI'm also curious about what he has to do as Mr. Crows on his back."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_5_2,"However,\nI would like to thank\nyou for leading us to this point."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_6_1,"If you borrow the power of Tenma Falchion, you will definitely be able to break through\nthe Great Demon King's barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_110_6_2,"Now, let's head to the twisting, strange land\nof Solaria Canyon, which has changed...\nto the castle of the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_1_1,"We were finally able to\nbreak the barrier to the palace."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_1_2,"Now, let's go defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_2_1,"The power of Pegasus is amazing...\nIt has broken the barrier that did not budge."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_2_2,"Well, it's finally the decisive battle.\nLet's go! {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_3_1,"Mr. {pc}!\nWe were able to break the barrier!\nNow we can go to the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_4_1,"That horse called Pegasus...\nHe can fly and destroy barriers.\nHe's an excellent guy!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_4_2,"I've never seen a horse that looks so good and is so good!\nI don't want to get close to it!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_5_1,"Tenma Falchion was able to break such a strong barrier..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_5_2,"I can't go with you to the Great Demon King, but\nI'm sure he'll support you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_6_1,"As expected of Tenma Falchion,\nI couldn't break that barrier with my heroic power alone."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_111_6_2,"While you support us so that the barrier that opened\ndoes not close again,\nlet us go inside!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_1_1,"That's an annoying number of monsters...\nLet's quickly take care of them and hurry to the Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_2_1,"The palace is full of\nmonsters."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_2_2,"This is the castle of the Great Demon King.\nThe air also feels stagnant."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_3_1,"In the past, I would have been so scared\nthat I would have lost my footing, but\nnow I'm fine!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_3_2,"So {pc}!\nPlease watch my fight!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_4_1,"I want to meet\njunk, not monsters!\nMonsters are a nuisance!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_5_1,"There are a lot of\nmonsters in the palace as it is home to the Great Demon King.\nIf you're not careful, you might get unexpectedly injured."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_1,"Heroes and allies...\nAnd let's combine everyone's power to defeat the Great Demon King Madesagora!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_2,"...I won't let my ally Sama do all the cool\n.\nYou can have high hopes for me even before my wedding."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_3,"Don't expect too much from me!\nI'm confident in my ability to be a jerk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_4,"It's just like that...\nBut if it's just like usual,\nI might feel relieved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_112_6_5,"I've come this far because I'm with you all.\nI'm not worried now.\n...Now, let's go!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_1_1,"The power we have cultivated on our\njourneys so far...\nWe will put it to full use!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_2_1,"If I lost to the Great Demon King's minions,\nI wouldn't have the face to match\nto those who believed in me..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_2_2,"...That's why I will never\nkneel!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_3_1,"We will definitely defeat the Great Demon King!\nWe will face you again and again!\nHey! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_4_1,"I lost to the great demon king's henchmen...\nThis kind of clumsy behavior is not the kind of clumsyness that\nI like."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_4_2,"Come on, former Junkie No. 2! Once again\nI'll go to that subordinate!\nI'll show you my ponkotsu power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_5_1,"Today, we have\na strong will and a sense of mission to defeat the Great Demon King!\nMr. {pc}! Let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_6_1,"Demon Marshal Zeldorado...\nAs expected, he is not an easy opponent..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_118_6_2,"But we will stand up again and again and protect this world.\nLet's go! {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_1_1,"The Great Demon King wasn't in the palace...\nI feel like I'm being made fun of.\nI'll definitely find him!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_2_1,"Damn it...!\nWhere did the Great Demon King Yarrow disappear to!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_3_1,"If we don't find the disappeared Great Demon King quickly,\nthe Great Demon King's plan will be completed!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_3_2,"Are Falchion and Anlucia somewhere in\nthe Temple of Light?\nLet's look for them, {pc}."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_4_1,"Now that the Great Demon King is gone, does that mean I can take over\nthe junk that was in the palace?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_5_1,"An evil person called the Great Demon King is seeking the spiritual core of creation, going so far as to obtain\nthe power of the hero."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_120_5_2,"I don't know how bad it is, but\nwe have to stop it before the Great Demon King gets his hands on it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_1_1,"I can't believe I'm stuck in the barrier left by the Great Demon King...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_1_2,"...Anyway, let's go find\nthe magical power of creation.\nThe evil cave of creation was the false island of Ethene."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_2_1,"If you come here, you will be blocked by the barrier again..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_2_2,"...The Great Demon King is\nan annoying bastard!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_3_1,"Demon King...I can't forgive you for always getting in our way!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_4_1,"I don't know if it's a garden or a pillow, but\nI think there's some unknown junk behind that gate!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_4_2,"Come on, former Junkie No. 2!\nI'll make sure you get to the gate as soon as possible!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_5_1,"We must break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor\nand rush to the gates of the abyss.\nFirst, let's obtain the magical power of creation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_1,"The Great Demon King is using\nBig Brother Toma to open the gates of the abyss...\nThe power of the hero..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_2,"I won't let that happen.\nI can't let Touma-nii become a\ntool of the Great Demon King's ambition any longer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_150_6_3,"In order to break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor, let us fulfill Falchion's request!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_1_1,"If you have this magical power of creation, you can break through the\nbarrier and go to the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_1_2,"Let's return to the Temple of Light!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_2_1,"I have obtained the magical power of creation.\nWill this be able to break the barrier of the Temple of Light...\nNow, let's return to Pegasus."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_3_1,"This is the magical power of creation...\nI wonder what it is... Even though it's a power that comes from a monster,\nI feel a strange warmth..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_3_2,"Ah! By the way, {pc}!\nWe must return to the Temple of Light quickly before the Great Demon King's plan goes forward!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_4_1,"I'm always forced to do things that are useful...\nSometimes it's of no use to anyone\nPlease let me suffer!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_4_2,"You can't shake until something like this, old man...\nAfter you blow up the demon king's bastard,\nyou can do whatever you want, so be patient."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_5_1,"If you bring back the goblet filled with the magical power of creation to Lord Falchion,\nyou can finally defeat the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_6_1,"Even while this is going on, the Great Demon King Madesagora should be steadily approaching\nthe gates of the abyss in search of the spiritual core of creation."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_160_6_2,"Let's hurry and deliver\nthe Mystic Goblet to Lord Falchion in order to break the barrier set in the Eternal Corridor!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_1_1,"The power of the hero Anlucia and\nher ally {pc} was necessary to break\nthe barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_1_2,"Now, let's go beyond the\nEternal Corridor to stop the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_2_1,"I've been stuck a lot, but...\nI'm finally able to blow away the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_3_1,"The Great Demon King is scary, but\neveryone is here for me, so\nI can move forward...!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_4_1,"I'm tired of being shown\nthe superior qualities of the princess and the former Junkie No. 2, but if there is\njunk ahead of me, I'll give it to you!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_5_1,"As expected of the power of a hero and his ally...\nIt's amazing that you were able to break such a strong barrier."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_1,"We were finally able to break\nthe barrier set in the Eternal Corridor."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_2,"I can't let Toma-nii become a tool of the Great Demon King's ambition any longer..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_3,"I may not be able to do it with my own strength, but now everyone is by my side.\nI will definitely stop the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_161_6_4,"Come on {pc}.\nLet's hurry and aim for the end of the Eternal Corridor.\nOur final battle awaits."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_1_1,"I guess what happened earlier was just a hallucination.\nI was playing training with Arold and Giganf when they were young..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_1_2,"I couldn't do the same rigorous training as adults, so it was just a game, but...\nIt was nostalgic and fun..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_2_1,"...Was that a hallucination?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_2_2,"There's no way my best friend\nis still alive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_1,"It was\na hallucination that your mother was alive..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_2,"Even though I couldn't ride the Kamusha properly,\nmy mother gently hugged me\nand comforted me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_3_3,"I'm fine now, but I just felt like I didn't want to leave you for a little while."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_1,"Was it just a hallucination?\nWhen I woke up, I was back in the junk castle.\nAnd what's more, Chiri had turned into a baby."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_2,"Chiri is just a useless cry.\nEverything is a mess.\nOh no, it was so nostalgic!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_4_3,"I could have stayed a little longer, but\nthe unseen junk of Lendersia is waiting for me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_1,"I had a vision that I became the king of Megistris and was\nsupported by my living father and mother..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_2,"They were\nhappy that I became king...\nThey looked very happy."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_3,"I thought\nthat I wanted to stay with these two forever... But I have to protect the real people of\nMegistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_163_5_4,"I will fight with everyone so that I can become a king that my father and mother can be proud of."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_1,"Did I just have a hallucination?\nWhen I woke up, I was in a big tailor's shop with my father and Arold."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_2,"Then they offered me\nall kinds of clothes.\nThey said they would buy me as many clothes as I wanted."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_3,"I realized that it was just a hallucination, so I refused because the battle with the Great Demon King Madesagora wasn't over yet."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_1_4,"However, one of the things that was recommended to me was\na costume that looked like something a bride would wear...\nThat was very beautiful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_1,"The store I was looking at was a\nweapon shop with an outstanding selection of items.What's more, it was a very generous store that would give you everything\nfor free."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_2,"I thought that if I had a good weapon, I could help you even more\n..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_2_3,"I thought that even if I received a good weapon, it would be meaningless if I didn't become stronger myself.\nI kind of lost interest in it and left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_3_1,"The hallucination I had was... Keki shop!\nIt was a shop that sold a lot of wonderful Keki dolls!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_3_2,"It was a lot of fun, but...\nI thought the {pc} guys were gone, so I went outside the shop and they disappeared..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_4_1,"I just went out to ask you to carry\nmore junk than I could carry by myself, and\nit disappeared..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_4_2,"Not only is it junk, but it was a hallucination\nIt's so useless that I like it, but\nIt's a shame to have so much junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_1,"...The hallucination I saw was that people from other countries were giving away large amounts of money and\ntreasures for\nMegistris."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_2,"I was worried for the sake of my people, and I remembered\nmy father... so I refused."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_3,"Rather than relying on others for everything, I want to make Megistris a good country with my own hands."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_165_5_4,"I'm sure my father will\napprove of me."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_1,"I had a vision of training\nin a battle royale with extremely strong people gathered on a mysterious isolated island!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_2,"Among them were Arold and Giganf...\nAnd my father was there too!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_3,"There were a lot of other strong people I met on my travels so far.\nBut for some reason, they were all men."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_1_4,"Huh? How did they come out?\nOf course I defeated them all and came out!\nEven though it was a hallucination, I feel like it was a good training session!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_2_1,"...I had a hallucination of being hugged by all kinds of women.\nIt was so annoying that I quickly left."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_2_2,"...What is it? {pc}.\nUnfortunately, I don't have the time to mess with women."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_3_1,"I had a hallucination where men were saying something that made my heart skip a beat...\nI was so embarrassed that I ran away..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_3_2,"Ugh...I've never confessed anything like that before\nso I'm still really nervous..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_1,"Third hallucination...?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_2,"Chiri was a baby, and\nthere was a lot of wonderful junk...\nThose are the only two things, right?"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_4_3,"If there was such a thing as a third hallucination,\nit would have been such a boring hallucination that I don't even remember it at all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_5_1,"That... It was a hallucination of being praised by women I didn't know..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_166_5_2,"I'm not very used to women, so\nI want you to stop pulling pranks like that..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_1_1,"Anlucia is back too, so it's finally time for the decisive battle with the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_2_1,"Anlucia was able to join us safely.\nIn order to defeat the Great Demon King, we need the hero Sama!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_3_1,"I'm glad Anlucia is safe...\nAfter all, we all have to defeat the Great Demon King\n, {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_4_1,"Finally, the princess has returned.\nWithout the princess, I can't defeat the Great Demon King\nand collect junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_5_1,"If we don't have the brave Princess Anlucia and\nour ally {pc} together,\nwe won't be able to fully utilize our powers."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_5_2,"Now, let's go defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_1,"Lord Falchion said\nthat those who aim for the gates of the abyss will have their hearts tested.\nI can't believe that's what happened..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_2,"...That's right.\nWas something like that happening at {pc}?\nThat was certainly painful..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_167_6_3,"But {pc} and I\nnever succumbed to such temptation.\nWe can definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_1_1,"I gained a lot of power from my long journey with {pc} and others."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_1_2,"No matter how many times I lose, I will get back up every time!\nAnd I will definitely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_2_1,"I'm just like Anlucia.\nThere are people I want to protect in this world."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_2_2,"So that they can laugh and live their lives\n...I will absolutely defeat the Great Demon King!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_3_1,"I'm not afraid.\n{pc} and everyone else are here, so\nI can fight properly..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_3_2,"I won't lose!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_4_1,"Moki!\n{pc}! If we don't defeat them quickly,\nwe won't be able to collect junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_5_1,"The power of the enemy is still strong.\nBut for the sake of the future...\nWe will not give in!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_6_1,"If we give up,\nthe world will be the way the Great Demon King wishes...\nLet's go to the gates of the abyss once again!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_168_6_2,"Release Brother Thoma\nand crush the ambitions of Great Demon King Madesagora\nthis time!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1,"I want to inform Father and Arold that I defeated the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2,"I also want to tell my father and mother\nUncle Nablett!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1_flag10035_out,"I'm sure there are still\npeople in Astortia waiting for our help."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_1_flag10035,"Milt will continue to serve\nthe country..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2_flag10035_out,"So {pc}!\nPlease continue to take\nto all kinds of places!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_1_2_flag10035,"I have to become even stronger so that I can\nprotect everyone even if the next enemy comes."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1,"Finally, I was able to defeat the Great Demon King!\nHe was pretty strong, so I think my armor has also improved."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1_flag10035_out,"Where are you going from now on?\nMy journey with you will be training for the sword.\nI'm still planning on following you."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_2_1_flag10035,"We were able to destroy the Great Demon King's plan.\nFrom now on, I guess the days will be peaceful."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1,"To think that I, along with everyone else, defeated\nthe Great Demon King...\nI just can't believe it."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1_flag10035_out,"{pc}! From now on, I want to\nlearn all sorts of things as we travel! So... please help me!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_3_1_flag10035,"I'm glad you were able to defeat\nthe Great Demon King for everyone living in this world! Mr. {pc}!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1,"I want to be the most\nuseless man in Astortia, so I helped\nexterminate the Great Demon King."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_2,"From now on, you'll be helping\nfind my junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1_flag10035_out,"Come on, former Junkie No. 2!\nOh no, {pc}! I'm going to look for\njunk all over Astortia!!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_1_flag10035,"It's a good thing\nto be able to focus on collecting junk now that the Great Demon King is gone!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_4_2_flag10035,"Former Junkie No. 2! Hurry\nLet's head to the next collection of junk!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1,"As the Prince of Megistris,\nI am very proud to be able to defeat the Great Demon King with you all!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1_flag10035_out,"As the heir to the throne of the Megistris Kingdom, I want to experience more things and learn how to protect the people."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_1_flag10035,"With the help of the talented Milt,\nI think the Kingdom of Grand Zedora will further develop."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_2_flag10035_out,"So, Mr. {pc}\n, we look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_5_2_flag10035,"I also want to make the Megistris Kingdom a good country so that it can stand on par with the Kingdom of Gran Zedora."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1,"Thanks to everyone, I was able to free Big Brother Toma from\nthe spell of the Great Demon King Madesagora\nand was able to speak with him one last time."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2,"...I have to tell Milt too.\nWe witnessed the end of Big Brother Toma...\nNo. The last moments of the hero Toma."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1_flag10035_out,"Since you're talking about {pc},\nyou'll continue to help people in need, right?\nOf course I'll help too."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_1_flag10035,"{pc}...Thank you for\nfighting with me until the end."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2_flag10035_out,"You don't have to worry, we have permission from your father, mother, and Lushenda.\nWe look forward to your continued support!"
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_2_flag10035,"Regardless of whether you're my ally or not, I'm really grateful to you.\nIt's because of you that I was able to get this far."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_3_flag10035,"My mission as a hero is over, but\nI still have a big job left to do: protect this kingdom on Big Brother Toma's behalf."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_4_flag10035,"I want to borrow your power from here on out, but\nI have a feeling that an even greater\ndestiny awaits you..."
PT_TALK_TXT_27_200_6_5_flag10035,"But {pc} don't forget.\nJust as you were by my side,\nI'll be by your side!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_1_1,"{pc}, everyone\n, thank you very much."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_2_1,"...In the end, there's nothing we can do.\nEven the wise old man can't be trusted."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_1,"{pc}...\nI understand how Fifi feels."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_2,"The adults around me have high expectations for me, but what should I do if I can't live up to their expectations...\nDo I really have that kind of power?"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_3_3,"But {pc} and the others\ngave me courage.\nNext time, I want to be that girl's power!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_4_1,"For a child, there's nothing sparkly about him.\nHe seems to have given up on something...\nThere's a lot to see!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_15_5_1,"If {pc} is involved,\nmy predictions won't work..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_1_1,"Is that the heir of Hajashu that everyone was talking about?\nHe really doesn't seem to have any motivation..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_2_1,"...It didn't seem to resonate much."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_2_2,"I guess so.\nIt seems like you were a little worried about us?"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_3_1,"Hehe. Fifi, it seems like you care\nabout us."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_4_1,"She's still a good-looking girl without any training!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_5_1,"I can understand a little bit how Fifi and Fuura feel\n.\nFuura! Let's do our best!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_25_5_2,"Yeah! Let's do our best, Raguas!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_1_1,"...I can hardly believe that you were listless and just reading books."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_2_1,"...I feel like he's changed somehow.\nHis attitude is the same as always, but\nhe's a lot more motivated."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_3_1,"Hehe. Fifi\nYou're really motivated.\nJust a little more... just a little more!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_4_1,"Hmm, I thought she was a floppy girl with a lot to offer\n, but I guess I was wrong."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_35_5_1,"Mr. Fifi, you're very motivated.\nWe can't afford to lose either!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_1_1,"Finally, we can fly to the Netherlord Nergel's place!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_2_1,"Ooh! That brat finally did it! With that, we can fly\ninto the Hades' Heart!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_3_1,"{pc}, she did it! Fifi learned the\nSacred Ship art!"
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_3_2,"I was able to help too, by cheering her on..."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_4_1,"Aaaah... In the end, she found her drive, didn't she.\nChiri had that same look when she was a kid; how\ndisappointin'."
PT_TALK_TXT_200_50_5_1,"At last, the decisive battle with the Netherlord at\nhand... {pc}, let us go properly prepare!"
