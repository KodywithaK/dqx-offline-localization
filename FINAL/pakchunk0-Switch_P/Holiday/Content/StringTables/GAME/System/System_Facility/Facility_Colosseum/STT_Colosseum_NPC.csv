SYSTXT_COLOSSEUM_NPC_01080,"Allow me to explain the rules\nof participating in War Fan Tasm!\n<br>\nThe rules are simple: fight the opposing team\nuntil they are knocked out, or until you are\nknocked out. The team who is still standing wins!\n<br>\nYour HP and MP will be restored before each\nfight even if you are KO'd. But\nyour tension will start at zero.\n<br>\nSome effects from outside will not\nfollow you into the arena such as\nthe bungee jump at Gert Strait.\n<br>\nAlso, the effects of any poison or curse\nwill be removed between rounds.\n<br>\nDuring battle you may use tools at will,\nincluding food and cooking items.\n<br>\nYour moves in battle are counted,\nthe fewer moves you make to win,\nthe more successful you will be.\n<br>\nThat's the whole spiel. Now go out there\nand show the world what you can do!\n<br_break>"

Everyone show the world\nhow strong you really are!\n<br_break>"

You don't remember fighting\nthe last enemy at all? Are you sure?\n<br>\nWell... Between you and me...\n<br>\nIn the past we have received reports from\nchallengers having trouble remembering matches\nthey just fought.\n<br>\nHowever, we have always used the monster memory\nmachines according to the user manual.\n<br>\nWithout knowing the participants memories\nfirst-hand, it makes it really hard to\nhelp...\n<br>\nThe machines creator once explained to me that\nif a person has forgotten or distorted memories...\n<br>\nOr there is always the possibility that memories are getting mixed up...\n<br>\nIt could cause a lot of unusual\nbehaviour. So maybe it's something like\nthat which has happened.\n<br>\nHowever, since you were able to defeat\nthe opponent all the same, I congratulate\nyou {pc}!\n<br>\nThank you for joining us for\n'The War Fan Tasm Remembrance Tourney!'\n<br>\nWell then, one more time...\n<br_break>"
